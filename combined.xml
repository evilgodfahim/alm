Steve Holland, Matt Spetalnick and Humeyra Pamuk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump will roll out the red carpet for Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, on Tuesday for a visit expected to advance the sale of F-35 fighter jets and a host of business deals with the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be the first trip by bin Salman, widely known as MBS, to the U.S. since the 2018 killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, which triggered global outrage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will receive a lavish welcome from US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, signing defense and nuclear deals during his first visit to the United States since the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump is expected to roll out the red carpet for the prince with a fly-by, cannon fire and a gala dinner -- giving the Saudi the equivalent of a state dinner, even though he is not a head of state and is only the kingdom's de facto ruler.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 06:30:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>W.Sahara

ultimate decision-making authority over any such measures, a senior White House official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump told reporters late on Sunday that it was "OK with me" that Republicans were working on legislation to impose sanctions on countries doing business with Russia over Moscow's failure to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025

-Hamas rejected the United Nations Security Council passing a U.S.-drafted resolution endorsing U.S. President Donald Trump's Gaza plan, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands and seeks to impose an international trusteeship on the enclave that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation," the group added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 22:36:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rights group cites 98 Palestinian deaths in Israeli detention during Gaza

-At least 98 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention since the Gaza war erupted in October 2023, a rights group said on Monday, alleging torture and medical neglect and calling for an

facilities and 52, all from the Gaza Strip, died in military custody. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 21:36:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Netanyahu slams 'extremist' Israeli
