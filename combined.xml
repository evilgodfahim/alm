&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be at the White House on November 18 for an official working visit with U.S. President Donald Trump, a White House official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visit comes as Trump pushes Saudi Arabia to join the list of nations that have joined the Abraham Accords. In 2020, Trump reached deals with United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco to normalize relations with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saudis have been hesitant to join in the absence of steps toward Palestinian statehood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) -Chancellor Friedrich Merz has invited Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to Germany to discuss deporting Syrian citizens with criminal records in Germany, the German leader said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will, of course, continue to deport criminals to Syria. That is the plan. We will now implement this in a very concrete manner," Merz told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany also wants to help stabilise the country, he said, adding that he intends to discuss with Sharaa "how we can solve this together".&lt;/p&gt;
