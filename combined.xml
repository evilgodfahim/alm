&lt;p&gt;CAIRO (Reuters) -Israel said on Monday that the Red Cross had handed over the body of another deceased hostage from Gaza to the Israeli military, according to a statement by the Israeliprime minister's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the identity of the deceased hostage is confirmed, it would mean that the remains of 12 hostages remain in Gaza with Palestinian militant group Hamas citing obstacles to locating them in the rubble left by the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, Hamas' armed wing said it would hand over the body of a deceased hostage it recovered on Monday in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
