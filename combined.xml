the streets of Damascus on Tuesday, Syrians viewed their leader's visit to Washington as a shift towards the West that could pave the way to reviving the country's war-battered economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Donald Trump received Ahmed al-Sharaa, a first for a Syrian head of state since independence in 1946 and a crowning achievement for the former jihadist, whom Washington once sought to arrest in return for a $10 million bounty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"God willing, this visit will be a new beginning for Syria and an opening to the world after years of isolation,"

al-Joujou said, referring to the Muslim sunset devotion.
