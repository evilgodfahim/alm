U.S. President Donald Trump's senior envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to visit Israel for meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's military chief, two senior Israeli officials said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials said Witkoff's visit to the country was expected to begin on Tuesday. It comes amid heightened regional tensions with Iran, and as the Trump administration presses ahead with its plan to end the Gaza war. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:01:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Factbox-What to know about Gaza's Rafah border crossing</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/factbox-what-know-about-gazas-rafah-border-crossing</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/factbox-what-know-about-gazas-rafah-border-crossing</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;GAZA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Gaza's Rafah border, the only crossing connecting the besieged Palestinian enclave with Egypt, reopened on Monday for a limited number of travellers on foot after being sealed shut by Israel for nearly a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crossing was seized by Israel in May 2024, in the early months of its war against Hamas militants. Its reopening comes as a relief to Palestinians who want to leave Gaza for medical care or those who want to return after fleeing the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are details about Rafah as well as the coastal enclave's crossings with Israel. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:01:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran president orders talks with US as Trump hopeful of deal</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/iran-president-orders-talks-us-trump-hopeful-deal</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/iran-president-orders-talks-us-trump-hopeful-deal</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, local media said Monday, after US leader Donald Trump said he was hopeful of a deal to avert military action against the Islamic republic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the Iranian authorities' deadly response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, Trump has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:00:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iranian police detain four unspecified foreigners over unrest</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/iranian-police-detain-four-unspecified-foreigners-over-unrest</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/iranian-police-detain-four-unspecified-foreigners-over-unrest</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Iranian police have arrested four foreigners over last month's unrest, Iranian state media reported on Monday, without specifying their nationality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State media quoted Iranian police as saying the four foreigners had been arrested "in a raid inside their hideout".

But difficult questions remain unaddressed, including whether Hamas will disarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's plan, now in its second phase, has been shaken by repeated Israeli attacks that have killed hundreds in Gaza, as well as resistance by Hamas militants to lay down their weapons. Israeli officials say they are preparing for a return to war if Hamas refuses to disarm. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:01:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran examines diplomacy with US, hopes for results in coming days, official says</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/iran-examines-diplomacy-us-hopes-results-coming-days-official-says</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/iran-examines-diplomacy-us-hopes-results-coming-days-official-says</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Details of various diplomatic processes to manage tensions with the U.S. are being examined by Iran, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday, adding that Tehran hoped for results in the coming days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid a military buildup by the U.S. Navy near Iran, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters last week that Iran was "seriously talking" with Washington, hours after Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were underway.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:01:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel expected to reopen Gaza's Rafah border crossing to Egypt, with limits</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/israel-expected-reopen-gazas-rafah-border-crossing-egypt-limits</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/israel-expected-reopen-gazas-rafah-border-crossing-egypt-limits</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By Haseeb Alwazeer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAZA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Israel was expected to reopen the border between Gaza and Egypt on Monday for people on foot, a move that would allow Palestinians to leave the enclave and let back in those who want to return after fleeing Israel's war in the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reopening of the Rafah border crossing will be limited, with Israel demanding security checks for Palestinians entering and exiting.
