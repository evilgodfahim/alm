The EU must finally stand up for itself by activating its most powerful tool against economic pressure, the Anti-Coercion Instrument.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 12:22:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Are Markets Ignoring the Obvious About America?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-markets-remain-calm-despite-trump-turmoil-by-erin-lockwood-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-markets-remain-calm-despite-trump-turmoil-by-erin-lockwood-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Given that Donald Trump’s agenda should concern those who hold capital, many are wondering why there has been so little resistance to his administration from markets and Big Business.
