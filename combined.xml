&lt;p&gt;ISTANBUL (Reuters) -A Turkish court has issued another formal arrest order for Istanbul's jailed mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on suspicion of "political espionage", state-owned Anadolu news agency said on Monday, stepping up a long-running opposition crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imamoglu, a key rival of President Tayyip Erdogan, who has been in jail since March pending trial on separate corruption charges, received a fresh jail sentence in July for insulting and threatening the chief Istanbul prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imamoglu denies all charges against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke has said in a British newspaper interview he would not now perform in Israel, eight years after the band defied pro-Palestinian activists to play a Tel Aviv gig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Absolutely not. I wouldn't want to be 5,000 miles anywhere near the Netanyahu regime," he told The Sunday Times Magazine, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview with members of the British band -- whose UK number one albums include "OK Computer" and "Kid A" -- took place before this month's ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing the release of the jailed founder of the Kurdish militant group PKK is needed for the success of the emerging peace process with Turkey, one of the group's senior leaders told AFP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdullah Ocalan's "freedom is crucial for this process to advance with greater effectiveness," Devrim Palu told AFP in an interview in northern Iraq on Sunday as the PKK began withdrawing all of its fighters from Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocalan, who founded the PKK in 1978, is the embodiment of the Kurdish rebellion against Turkey which lasted more four decades and cost some 50,000 lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) -The outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group said on Sunday it was withdrawing from Turkey as part of a disarmament process it is coordinating with the government, and pressed Ankara for concrete measures to move the process along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PKK, which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, decided in May to disarm and disband after a call to end its armed struggle from its jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan. The fighting has killed more than 40,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
