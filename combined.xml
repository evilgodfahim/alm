&lt;p&gt;By Bhargav Acharya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) -The U.S. military's Middle East command on Wednesday called on Hamas to stop its violence against civilians in Gaza and disarm "without delay" as the militant group reasserts itself by deploying security forces and executing those it deems collaborators with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas, which has not publicly committed to disarming and cedingpower, has gradually sent its men back into the streets of Gaza since the ceasefire began on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pope Leo XIV will carry a message of peace to Lebanon and the Christians of the Middle East when he visits next month, Maronite Patriarch Beshara Rai told AFP on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vatican said last week that Pope Leo will travel to Turkey and Lebanon in a six-day trip beginning late November, his first since becoming head of the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rai, who heads the Maronite Church, religiously diverse Lebanon's most influential Christian sect, hailed the pontiff's visit at a time of truce in the conflict between Israel and Lebanon, as well as the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
