Yet by massaging the meaning of the term, that is precisely what its critics are seeking to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 14:00:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Bolsonaro and Trump Have Revealed the Biggest Threat to Democracy</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/diverging-fates-of-bolsonaro-and-trump-by-pedro-abramovay-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/diverging-fates-of-bolsonaro-and-trump-by-pedro-abramovay-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are emblematic of the contemporary era of competitive authoritarianism, and both attempted to overturn the result of a democratic election by inciting violence among their supporters.

But post-pandemic inflation and higher interest rates have shattered that narrative, exposing anti-austerity economics for the dangerous illusion it was all along.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:47:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Limits of Xi and Putin’s “No-Limits” Partnership</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/xi-putin-historical-mistrust-diverging-interests-despite-no-limits-partnership-by-ruby-osman-and-dan-sleat-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/xi-putin-historical-mistrust-diverging-interests-despite-no-limits-partnership-by-ruby-osman-and-dan-sleat-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia's obvious economic dependence on China, the Chinese are not yet dictating outcomes, and Russia is not acting like a junior partner.

Since this approach inevitably delivers bad economic outcomes over time, populist leaders need low interest rates to prevent their supporters from recognizing how misguided their policies are until it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 12:41:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump Brings the Incarceration Game to America</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-authoritarians-like-trump-use-incarceration-game-to-entrench-rule-by-kaushik-basu-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-authoritarians-like-trump-use-incarceration-game-to-entrench-rule-by-kaushik-basu-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By targeting critics like Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, US President Donald Trump threatens to turn the law into a tool of political repression.
