The group says it has abided by requirements for it to end its military presence in the border region near Israel, and for the Lebanese army to deploy there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 15:36:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Restorers dismantle and reconstruct a historic Cairo neighbourhood</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/restorers-dismantle-and-reconstruct-historic-cairo-neighbourhood</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/restorers-dismantle-and-reconstruct-historic-cairo-neighbourhood</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By Patrick Werr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAIRO (Reuters) -Egyptian restorers are reconstructing a dilapidated neighbourhood in Cairo's historic centre, dismantling houses and    then rebuilding them with materials from the old structures in a model they hope can be applied to other districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Darb al-Labbana neighbourhood is nestled on a slope directly under Cairo's more than eight-century-old citadel, a prominent landmark built by Muslim general Saladin, and abutting the back of a historic hospital complex. But in recent decades it had become largely uninhabitable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 15:01:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The gruelling search for Gaza's dead under the

he told AFP, pointing to the pile of broken concrete and twisted metal that was once a five-storey building in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025

Prince Mohammed bin Salman's trip to Washington has been a triumph, with Donald Trump rolling out the red carpet for "the future king" and absolving him of the criticism he has faced for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heir to the Saudi throne was given a lavish welcome during his visit to the White House Tuesday on par with what American leaders regularly receive when they visit the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip marked the first visit by the prince to the US since the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents sparked global outrage and transformed the heir

and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have repeatedly flared in recent years and were further inflamed after a 12-day war in June that saw Israeli and US strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the war, agency inspectors have not been granted access to sites such as Fordo and Natanz, which were hit in the strikes, but they have been able to visit other

destroying some shelters, soaking mattresses and blankets and bringing new misery even after a ceasefire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hamas-run Gaza government has estimated losses from the stormy weather at around $4.5 million, including 22,000 tents, spoiled food and medicines and damage to infrastructure, while local aid groups say 300,000 new tents are urgently needed.

in the backdrop of souring relations with neighbouring Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India last month upgraded its ties with the Taliban by reopening its embassy in Kabul that was shut after the Islamist group seized power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO forces. New Delhi is also ramping up its aid to the country as it competes with China for influence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:01:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France obtains
