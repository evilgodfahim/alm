&lt;p&gt;Sudan's army-aligned government accused paramilitaries on Wednesday of attacking civilians in mosques during their recent takeover of the western city of El-Fasher, where satellite images show evidence of "continuing mass killing", Yale researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capture of El-Fasher on Sunday after an 18-month siege marked by starvation and bombardment has solidified the Rapid Support Forces' (RSF) control over Darfur, sparking fears of ethnically motivated violence reminiscent of the region's darkest days.&lt;/p&gt;

Ankara has said it was also seeking 24 more jets, albeit lightly used, from Qatar and Oman.&lt;/p&gt;
