While cutting methane emissions in the steel supply chain will not produce green steel overnight, it could reduce the sector’s emissions by the equivalent of a billion tons of carbon annually, and at little cost.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:42:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>With America Out, the Rest of the West Must Rise</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rich-countries-in-europe-and-asia-must-defend-global-trade-and-cooperation-by-chin-huat-wong-and-wing-thye-woo-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rich-countries-in-europe-and-asia-must-defend-global-trade-and-cooperation-by-chin-huat-wong-and-wing-thye-woo-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The populist forces that propelled Donald Trump’s rise will continue to shape US politics long after he leaves office. Rather than wait around hoping for the US to re-embrace reason, democratic values, and global leadership, the “rest of the West” must step up to preserve the foundations of global stability and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:08:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China Plans, America Reacts</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reactive-industrial-policy-cannot-compare-to-china-five-year-plans-by-stephen-s-roach-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reactive-industrial-policy-cannot-compare-to-china-five-year-plans-by-stephen-s-roach-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s transactional strain of industrial policy has prompted many to ask whether he has embraced Chinese-style state capitalism. But Trumponomics, lacking an overarching strategy and largely based on the whims of one man, is nothing like China’s comprehensive “all-of-government” approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 13:23:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Robert Redford and the Leadership America Has Lost</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-redford-and-the-civic-political-leadership-america-has-lost-by-carla-norrlof-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-redford-and-the-civic-political-leadership-america-has-lost-by-carla-norrlof-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Through his films, conservation efforts, and the Sundance festival, Robert Redford enjoyed global fame for most of his adult life.
