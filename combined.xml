&lt;p&gt;The director of Oscar-shortlisted film "Palestine 36" said her big-budget production about a crucial but little-known Arab rebellion is a statement about Palestinians "refusal to disappear".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran filmmaker Annemarie Jacir started production on the sweeping historical epic just before Israel's devastating invasion of Gaza in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the movie was a "financial disaster", she admitted in an interview with AFP, but encouraging critical reaction since its debut last September and its shortlisting for an Oscar have offered solace. &lt;/p&gt;
