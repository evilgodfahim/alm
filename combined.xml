&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men rallied in Jerusalem on Thursday to protest against military conscription for their community, an issue that has caused major strain in Israel's right-wing ruling coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast crowd were demonstrating to demand a law guaranteeing their right to avoid Israel's mandatory military service -- long promised by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowds of men set fire to pieces of tarpaulin as hundreds of police officers cordoned off several roads across the city, AFP correspondents reported.&lt;/p&gt;
