-After 26 years in a Turkish prison, Abdullah Ocalan is carving out a key role for himself as Ankara tries to end his outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party's four-decade insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an event that was unimaginable a year ago, three Turkish lawmakers visited Ocalan on Monday to further the peace process following the PKK's announcement in May that it would disarm and disband.

Hannah Confino&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Researchers in Israel are hoping to make new discoveries about Jewish history by loading a digital database of manuscripts stretching back a thousand years into a new transcription tool that uses artificial intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cairo Geniza, the biggest collection of medieval Jewish documents in the world, has been the object of countless hours of study by scholars for more than a century but only a fraction of its over 400,000 documents have been thoroughly researched. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov

(Reuters) -The British government's decision to ban pro-Palestinian campaign group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation will be challenged in court on Wednesday, with lawyers representing a co-founder arguing it is a misuse of anti-terrorism laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palestine Action was proscribed in July, putting it on a par with Islamic State or al Qaeda and making it a crime to be a member, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 06:36:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Popemobile transformed into Gaza mobile

popemobile used by the late pope Francis on his 2014 visit to Bethlehem re-emerged on Tuesday as a mobile children's clinic to be deployed in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vehicle is still unmistakeable as a popemobile: pristine white inside and out, and with the familiar raised canopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But instead of transporting the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Roman Catholics, the re-branded "Vehicle of Hope" is now set to serve in the war-battered Gaza Strip, in accordance with the late pope's wishes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 01:30:25
