He also suggested that Hamas leadership was not involved in any alleged breaches and instead blamed "some rebels within."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But either way, it's going to be handled properly.

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) -The Israeli military has launched an attack on Gaza, as Israel continued to trade blame with Palestinian militant group Hamas over violations of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire aiming to end the war in the enclave, Israeli media reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate comment from the military or Hamas on the reported attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli public broadcaster Kan said the air force was attacking Rafah in the south of Gaza. Most media outlets described the attack as air strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
