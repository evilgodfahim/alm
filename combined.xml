security forces fired tear gas on Tuesday to disperse demonstrators at the Tehran bazaar, as an NGO said more than two dozen people had been killed in a crackdown on the most significant protests to hit the Islamic republic in three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protests were triggered by anger over the rising cost of living, with the Iranian rial losing value again on Tuesday to reach another record low against foreign currencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:00:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Explainer-Why is Somaliland strategically
