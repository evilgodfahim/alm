&lt;p&gt;With Gaza's education system shattered by two years of gruelling war, UNICEF's regional director says he fears for a "lost generation" of children wandering ruined streets with nothing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the third year that there has been no school," Edouard Beigbeder, the UN agency's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, told AFP in Jerusalem on Thursday after returning from the Palestinian territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we don't start a real transition for all children in February, we will enter a fourth year. And then we can talk about a lost generation."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top US diplomat Marco Rubio voiced hope Friday of soon putting together an international force to police the ceasefire in Gaza, as Palestinian factions agreed that a committee of technocrats would run the post-war territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secretary of state visited Israel on the heels of Vice President JD Vance as part of an all-out effort by the United States to persuade both Hamas and Israel to respect the truce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubio said it was critical for the deal to create "the conditions for the stabilisation force to come in as soon as it possibly can be put together".&lt;/p&gt;
