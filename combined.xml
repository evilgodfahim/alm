Prince Mohammed bin Salman's trip to Washington has been a triumph, with Donald Trump rolling out the red carpet for "the future king" and absolving him of the criticism he has faced for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heir to the Saudi throne was given a lavish welcome during his visit to the White House Tuesday on par with what American leaders regularly receive when they visit the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip marked the first visit by the prince to the US since the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents sparked global outrage and transformed the heir into a pariah.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:30:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UN nuclear head renews call for Iran to allow inspections at key

head of the UN nuclear agency on Wednesday renewed his call for Iran to allow inspections at key nuclear sites attacked by Israel and the United States in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have repeatedly flared in recent years and were further inflamed after a 12-day war in June that saw Israeli and US strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the war, agency inspectors have not been granted access to sites such as Fordo and Natanz, which were hit in the strikes, but they have been able to visit other sites.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 14:30:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaza water provider resumes services after Hamas frees

came after the issue was resolved, adding that the staff member was "fine and in good health".&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:36:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Gaza storms

destroying some shelters, soaking mattresses and blankets and bringing new misery even after a ceasefire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hamas-run Gaza government has estimated losses from the stormy weather at around $4.5 million, including 22,000 tents, spoiled food and medicines and damage to infrastructure, while local aid groups say 300,000 new tents are urgently needed.

DELHI (Reuters) -Afghanistan's Taliban trade minister arrived in India on Wednesday on a maiden visit to draw greater investments and goods as both countries consider ways to enhance their relations in the backdrop of souring relations with neighbouring Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India last month upgraded its ties with the Taliban by reopening its embassy in Kabul that was shut after the Islamist group seized power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO forces. New Delhi is also ramping up its aid to the country as it competes with China for influence.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:01:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France obtains
