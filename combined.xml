&lt;p&gt;TUNIS (Reuters) -Tunisia has repatriated about 10,000 irregular migrants so far this year, most of them from sub-Saharan African countries, Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Nafti said on Tuesday, as the North African country faces pressure from the European Union to stem crossings across the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nafti told lawmakers that the repatriations were carried out through a voluntary return program coordinated with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), with weekly flights arranged to help migrants return home. &lt;/p&gt;

Medical supplies would follow soon, he said, as his ministry promoted the hashtag #IndiaFirstResponder on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Kirsty Needham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) -The work of Australia's defence force to protect its sea trade routes, including through the South China Sea, is becoming more risky as Beijing undertakes the "biggest military build-up in the world today", Australia's defence minister said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open sea lanes, including trade routes that go through the South China Sea and East China Sea, were at the core of Australia's national interest, Richard Marles said in an opening speech at a navy conference in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be at the White House on November 18 for an official working visit with U.S. President Donald Trump, a White House official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visit comes as Trump pushes Saudi Arabia to join the list of nations that have joined the Abraham Accords. In 2020, Trump reached deals with United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco to normalize relations with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saudis have been hesitant to join in the absence of steps toward Palestinian statehood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That is the plan. We will now implement this in a very concrete manner," Merz told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany also wants to help stabilise the country, he said, adding that he intends to discuss with Sharaa "how we can solve this together".&lt;/p&gt;
