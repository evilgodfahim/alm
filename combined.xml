President Joseph Aoun on Friday told a United Nations Security Council delegation his country does not want war with Israel, days after civilian representatives from both sides held their first talks in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem, whose militant group refuses to disarm, on Friday backed Lebanon's pursuit of diplomacy but called the inclusion of a civilian representative in talks with Israel a "misstep".&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 16:00:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Palestinians say Israeli army killed man in occupied West

Ireland and Slovenia said they would withdraw from next year's competition in protest at Israel's participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planned boycott brought to a head a row that has overshadowed the past two contests, and followed threats by the four they would pull out if the organiser did not exclude Israel over the conduct of its war against Hamas in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri,

Dec 5 (Reuters) - Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem on Friday criticised the Lebanese government's decision to send a civilian delegate to the ceasefire committee, calling it a "free concession" to Israel
