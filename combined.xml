&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran has scrapped a cooperation deal that it signed with the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA in September, its Supreme National Security Council Secretary said on Monday, according to state media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement came around three weeks after Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said Tehran would scrap the agreement, which let the IAEA resume inspections of its nuclear sites, if Western powers reinstated U.N. sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those were reinstated last month.&lt;/p&gt;
