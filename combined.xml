&lt;p&gt;LISBON (Reuters) -Portugal's parliament approved on Friday a bill to ban face veils used for "gender or religious motives" in most public spaces that was proposed by the far-right Chega party and effectively targets burqas and niqabs worn by Muslim women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the bill, proposed fines for wearing face veils in public would range between 200 euros and 4,000 euros ($234-$4,671). Forcing someone to wear one would be punishable with prison terms of up to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face veils would still be allowed in aeroplanes, diplomatic premises and places of worship. &lt;/p&gt;

But further steps have been held up in part by Israeli accusations that the militants were too slow in handing over bodies of dead hostages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK media watchdog on Friday sanctioned the BBC for a Gaza documentary whose child narrator was later revealed to be the son of Hamas's former deputy minister of agriculture, branding it "materially misleading".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster earlier this year apologised for "serious flaws" in the making of "Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone" and pulled it from its platform after a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster said it shared the blame for the "unacceptable" flaws with UK production company Hoyo Films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said he expected an expansion of the Abraham Accords soon and hopes Saudi Arabia will join the pact that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and some Arab states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in," Trump said in an interview broadcast on Friday on Fox Business Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said he had had "some very good conversations" as recently as Wednesday with states that have indicated their willingness to join the accords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) -The U.N. World Food Programme said on Friday it has brought about 560 tonnes of food per day on average into Gaza since the  Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect, but that still fell short of the scale of need in the enclave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With famine conditions present in parts of Gaza, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher said on Wednesday that thousands of aid vehicles would now have to enter Gaza weekly to ease the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's media regulator Ofcom said a BBC documentary about children's lives in Gaza narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government broke broadcasting rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the failure to disclose the position of the boy's father was "materially misleading".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC removed "Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone" from its online platform in February, five days after it was broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its own investigation found in July that the programme had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
