Tehran said any attack on Khamenei would trigger a "holy war".&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:36:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel military says remains of last Gaza hostage Ran Gvili returned</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/01/israel-military-says-remains-last-gaza-hostage-ran-gvili-returned</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/01/israel-military-says-remains-last-gaza-hostage-ran-gvili-returned</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military said on Monday that the remains of the last hostage held in Gaza, Ran Gvili, had been identified and were being repatriated to Israel for burial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement put an end to a lengthy process to locate and return the last of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas militants during their October 2023 attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday hailed the return of all those held captive "down to the very last".&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:00:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran broadcasting forced 'confessions' to deter dissent: activists</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/01/iran-broadcasting-forced-confessions-deter-dissent-activists</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/01/iran-broadcasting-forced-confessions-deter-dissent-activists</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The man faces the camera with his face blurred as dramatic music pounds in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I made a mistake," he says, his voice trembling as an unseen interrogator presses him about the deaths of members of Iran's security forces. "If I'd known, I would not have done it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one rights group, at least 240 such "forced confessions" have been broadcast by Iranian state television in recent weeks -- an "unprecedented" quantity -- after authorities arrested thousands of people in the wake of protests that shook the country's clerical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026

Jan 26 (Reuters) - Italy will ask European Union partners this week to place Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) on the EU's terrorist register, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Monday, signalling a shift in Rome's position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, Rome had been among the governments resisting efforts to brand the IRGC as a terrorist group, but Tajani said a bloody Iranian crackdown on street protests this month that reportedly killed thousands of people could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:36:35
