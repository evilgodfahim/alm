&lt;p&gt;Turkey's military is ready to "support" Syria in its battle with Kurdish fighters in the northwestern city of Aleppo if Damascus asks for help, a defence ministry official said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Turkey's top diplomat said Ankara had been working "intensively" with Syrian and American officials in a bid to end the unrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly clashes erupted this week between Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) after the two sides failed to reach a year-end deadline to merge the Kurdish fighters into the main Damascus military. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Jana Choukeir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Syrian army clashed with fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in parts of Aleppo on Thursday and ordered residents to evacuate, accusing the SDF of using Kurdish-majority areas to launch attacks, according to Syrian state media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The army released more than seven maps identifying areas it said would be targeted in strikes, urging residents to leave immediately for their safety. Its operations command announced a curfew in the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh from 3 p.m. (1200 GMT).    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Nidal al-Mughrabi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man.On December 29, Hamas announced that he had died, aged 49, around seven months after Israel said it killed him in a strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas did not provide details on Sinwar's death but said it mourned him along with other group leaders, describing them as "heroic martyrs". Hamas confirmed in the statement that Sinwar had been the head of the group's armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria's government on Wednesday demanded that Kurdish fighters leave the neighbourhoods they control in Aleppo following clashes between the two sides which saw thousands of civilians flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces traded blame over who started the deadly clashes on Tuesday, which killed 16 civilians and one defence ministry member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The violence comes as the two sides have so far failed to implement a March deal to merge the Kurds' semi-autonomous administration and military into Syria's new Islamist government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Saudi-led coalition struck the home province of Yemen's UAE-backed separatist leader on Wednesday, after he failed to show up for talks in Riyadh and was kicked out of the country's presidential body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coalition said it had given Aidaros Alzubidi a 48-hour ultimatum to come to Riyadh for discussions, after his Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he failed to board the flight carrying his delegation, and the coalition struck his home province of al-Dhale after accusing him of mobilising "large forces" there.&lt;/p&gt;
