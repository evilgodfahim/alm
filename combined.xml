Byron Kaye&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Dec 17 (Reuters) - After Australia's deadliest mass shooting in 1996, the country rushed in some of the world's toughest gun laws, including mandatory licensing and background checks, as well as registration of ​every firearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a winding back of those laws, failure to update them with the internet age and growing ​complacency with background checks may have made it easier for two suspects behind Sunday's shooting during a Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach to acquire weapons, gun safety experts said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 06:36:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia police charge alleged Bondi Beach gunman with 59 offences, including
