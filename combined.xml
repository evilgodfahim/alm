Year's Eve revellers toasted the end of 2025 on Wednesday, waving goodbye to 12 months packed with Trump tariffs, a Gaza truce and vain hopes for peace in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of the warmest years on record, the stifling heat stoking wildfires in Europe, droughts in Africa and deadly rains across Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a sombre tinge to party preparations in Australia's harbour city Sydney, the self-proclaimed "New Year's capital of the world".&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 20:30:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Analysis-Yemen

Saudi Arabia, but the incident has exposed simmering distrust between two Gulf oil powers with long-running differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airstrike by a Saudi-led coalition early on Tuesday on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla was followed by calls on all UAE forces to leave Yemen, and a statement from Riyadh that its national security was a red line.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue,
