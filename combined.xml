army said its operation in a Kurdish neighbourhood of Aleppo was nearing completion early Saturday and urged fighters from the minority to surrender themselves and their weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government forces began striking the Sheikh Maqsud district overnight after the Kurdish fighters defied a deadline to withdraw during a temporary ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A military source told the official SANA news agency that the combing operation in Sheikh Maqsud was "more than 90 percent" complete, and that "a number of SDF members" had been arrested. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 05:00:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Amid mass Iran protests, Trump takes cautious

that the unrest may not be widespread enough to challenge Tehran's clerical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent days Trump has warned Iranian leaders that there will be "hell to pay" if they crack down on the protest movement but has otherwise adopted a wait-and-see attitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 20:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>As Iran protests

Jan 9 (Reuters) - The European Union will grant Syria around 620 million euros ($722 million) this year and next for post-war recovery, bilateral support and humanitarian aid, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After years of devastation under the Assad regime, Syria's recovery and reconstruction needs are immense, and I just could see (it) by my own eyes," she said during a visit to the Syrian capital Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>'Palestine 36' director says film is

director of Oscar-shortlisted film "Palestine 36" said her big-budget production about a crucial but little-known Arab rebellion is a statement about Palestinians "refusal to disappear".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran filmmaker Annemarie Jacir started production on the sweeping historical epic just before Israel's devastating invasion of Gaza in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the movie was a "financial disaster", she admitted in an interview with AFP, but encouraging critical reaction since its debut last September and its shortlisting for an Oscar have offered solace. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US quits global organisation dedicated to preventing violent

while the risk of militant attacks surges in the Middle East and Africa's Sahel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, which supports prevention programmes across dozens of countries with communities vulnerable to extremism - appeared on Wednesday in a White House memo announcing a U.S. pullout from 35 international agencies and 31 U.N. entities it said
