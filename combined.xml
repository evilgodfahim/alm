&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would never bow to pressure from the United States or any other country, and cautioned that the response to any strikes deep into Russia would be very serious and overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. sanctions are an "unfriendly" act and "will have certain consequences, but they will not significantly affect our economic well-being," Putin said. Russia's energy sector feels confident, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fragile ceasefire has brought respite to Gazans exhausted by two years of fighting, but even without the daily bombing they are struggling to live amid the catastrophic destruction wrought by the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reconstruction task ahead is enormous, given that vast swathes of the Palestinian territory were flattened during Israel's military campaign and most of the population were displaced at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
