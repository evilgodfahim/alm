If they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, &amp;amp; BRUTAL!

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) -The U.N. World Food Programme said on Tuesday that supplies into Gaza were ramping up after the U.S.-brokered ceasefire but were still far short of its daily target of 2,000 tons because only two crossings are open, and none to the famine-hit north of the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 750 metric tons of food are now entering the Gaza Strip daily, according to the WFP, but this was still well below the scale of needs after two years of conflict between Israel and Hamas that has reduced much of Gaza to a wasteland and made nearly its entire population homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

By persuading Hamas to accept Donald Trump’s Gaza deal, Ankara has reasserted itself on the Middle East chessboard, to the dismay of Israel and Arab rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially resistant to the U.S. president's ultimatum -- free the Israeli hostages or face continued devastation -- Hamas leaders relented only when Turkey, a country they view as a political patron, urged them to agree to the American plan.&lt;/p&gt;
