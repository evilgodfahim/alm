&lt;p&gt;By Timour Azhari and Ahmed Rasheed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Iraq has pledged to bring all weapons under the control of the state, but that will not work so long as there is a U.S.-led coalition in the country that some Iraqi factions view as an occupying force, the prime minister said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said a plan was still in place to have the multinational anti-Islamic State coalition completely leave Iraq, one of Iran’s closest Arab allies, by September 2026 because the threat from Islamist militant groups had eased considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
