searching private homes in the south for weaponry, three Lebanese security officials and two Israeli officials have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demand has emerged in recent weeks and been rejected by Lebanon's military leadership, who fear it would ignite civil strife and derail a disarmament strategy seen by the army as cautious but effective, the Lebanese security officials told Reuters.
