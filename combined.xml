Fortunately, world leaders can address both issues by committing to health taxes at this week’s United Nations General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:25:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Clean Energy Is Inevitable Despite Trump</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/much-clean-energy-progress-since-paris-agreement-by-jennifer-morgan-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/much-clean-energy-progress-since-paris-agreement-by-jennifer-morgan-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The world is not on track to meet its climate targets, and the devastating effects of global warming are appearing faster than many anticipated.
