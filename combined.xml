It is up to citizens, and especially state governments, to resist.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 09:15:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Polycrisis Demands a Renewed Humanism</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/renewed-humanism-required-to-meet-global-challenges-by-edgar-morin-and-claudio-pedretti-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/renewed-humanism-required-to-meet-global-challenges-by-edgar-morin-and-claudio-pedretti-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the third decade of the twenty-first century, we are facing a confluence of escalating ecological, political, economic, technological, and existential crises, each of which is reinforcing the others.

Only with bold, coordinated reforms that close this gap can the country raise fertility to a level that, though still below replacement, would avert demographic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 11:45:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Can We Account for Crypto?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-to-measure-value-created-by-cryptocurrecies-by-tim-congdon-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-to-measure-value-created-by-cryptocurrecies-by-tim-congdon-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;National income accounting has always been complicated by what happens in the underground and informal economies.

In that event, the Fed would have cut rates this year, only to have to reverse course in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:40:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What a China-EU Climate Deal Could Do for the World</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-eu-climate-deal-in-absence-of-us-leadership-by-adair-turner-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-eu-climate-deal-in-absence-of-us-leadership-by-adair-turner-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With America having abandoned global leadership – especially on climate change – cooperation between China and Europe has become even more important.
