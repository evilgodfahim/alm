Like the panic over Japan's rise in the 1980s, the administration's response is unwarranted and counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 13:42:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Dangerous Disregard for International Justice</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-disdain-for-transitional-justice-outlier-among-us-presidents-by-ruti-teitel-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-disdain-for-transitional-justice-outlier-among-us-presidents-by-ruti-teitel-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Since its founding, America has been a consistent supporter of post-conflict justice, which was a powerful tool in the diplomatic arsenal of presidents of all political stripes.
