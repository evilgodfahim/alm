Alexander Cornwell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MANAMA (Reuters) -A de facto partition of Gaza between an area controlled by Israel and another ruled by Hamas is increasingly likely, multiple sources said, with efforts to advance U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the war beyond a ceasefire faltering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six European officials with direct knowledge of the efforts to implement the next phase of the plan told Reuters it was effectively stalled and that reconstruction now appeared likely to be limited to the Israel- controlled area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could lead to years of separation, they warned.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:36:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France's Macron to meet Palestinian president

President Emmanuel Macron will meet Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Paris on Tuesday to discuss the "full implementation" of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, the Elysee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The

Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbas, 89, is the longtime head of the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited control over parts of the West Bank and is being considered to assume governance in Gaza

invasion that toppled him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even now, the country of 46 million people suffers from poor infrastructure, failing public services and endemic

electorate sees as a vehicle for established parties to divide up the country's oil wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudani's bloc is forecast to win the most seats but fall short of a majority, potentially meaning months of post-election talks among Shi'ite and Sunni Muslim as well as Kurdish parties to divvy up government posts and pick a prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025
