Security Council resolution in the coming days that would lay the foundation for a future international force in Gaza, France said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a shaky U.S.-mediated ceasefire between Israel and Hamas holding, planning has begun for an international force to stabilize security in the Palestinian enclave, two senior U.S. advisers said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fragile ceasefire holds, displaced Palestinian residents of Gaza City have returned to their homes only to find rubble, with many of them forced to camp out in makeshift shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the northwest of the city, empty streets are lined with piles of concrete that once were apartment buildings before the Israel-Hamas war, with some structures completely collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hossam Majed discovered his home reduced to rubble. Amid the ruins, the 31-year-old salvaged a few belongings, including some furniture and -- crucially given the shortages -- a large water tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS (Reuters) -Greece said on Thursday it had agreed with Egypt on the future of St Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Egypt's Mount Sinai, one of the world's oldest sites of Christian worship whose status had led to a diplomatic spat between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athens had expressed concern about plans by Egypt to develop a tourism project around the site, where by Biblical tradition Moses received the Ten Commandments. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is still houses Greek Orthodox monks.&lt;/p&gt;
