200,000 people joined a demonstration against the Iranian government in Munich on Saturday, police said, as world leaders gathered nearby for a security conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protesters rallied on Munich's Theresienwiese fairgrounds, denouncing the leadership of Iran's Islamic Republic following the deadly repression of nationwide protests in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some waved flags with a lion and a sun against horizontal green, white and red stripes, the emblem of the monarchy overthrown in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 14:30:22

as Kurds seek to retain some authority despite a much weakened hand following the rapid advance of central government forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progress of the deal tests the ability of Syria's new leaders to stabilise a nation fractured by 14 years of war, following several bouts of violence pitting it against minority groups who are suspicious of the Islamist-led government.
