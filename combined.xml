&lt;p&gt;The lives of a French couple held by Iran for more than three years who were this week handed lengthy jail sentences for espionage are at risk, their families warned Thursday, as France condemned their conviction on "baseless" charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecile Kohler, 41, and Jacques Paris, 72, were arrested in May 2022 and have been detained ever since. Their current location is unknown after they were moved from Tehran's Evin prison in the wake of the Israeli strike on the facility in the June war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) -Britain is facing an escalating threat from hostile states such as Russia, Iran, and China while the terrorism risk is "huge" with al Qaeda and Islamic State seeking to incite would-be attackers, the UK's domestic spy chief said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MI5 Director General Ken McCallum said there had been a 35% increase in the number of people being investigated over state threat activity, saying hostile nations were consistently descending into the "ugly" methods usually employed by terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swedish prosecutors on Thursday sought the arrest a young Syrian man for killing Salwan Momika, who repeatedly burned copies of the Koran in 2023 and sparked outrage in the Muslim world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Momika, an Iraqi Christian, was shot on January 29 in an apartment in Sodertalje, south of Stockholm. He died soon after in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a clear picture of the sequence of events, and following extensive technical investigations and a review of the collected surveillance footage, we have requested that a person be remanded in custody," senior prosecutor Rasmus Oman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel’s military aid agency COGAT said on Thursday preparations are ongoing with Egypt to open the major Rafah border crossing with Gaza for the movement of people, with the date to be announced at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel had earlier warned it could keep Rafah shut and reduce aid into the Palestinian enclave as Hamas, it said, was returning the bodies of dead hostages too slowly, underlining the risks to a ceasefire that halted two years of devastating war and saw all living hostages held by Hamas released.&lt;/p&gt;
