&lt;p&gt;NICOSIA (Reuters) -Voters in breakaway north Cyprus went to the polls on Sunday in a presidential vote seen as a test on whether talks to reunify the divided island can be revived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incumbent Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar, who backs a two-state solution, faces the main centre-left rival Tufan Erhuman, who favours renewed United Nations-sponsored negotiations on a federal settlement with Greek Cypriots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatar's position for a two-state deal has been rejected by Greek Cypriots, while peace talks have been in deadlock since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

And the station's vaulted and arched concourse, with a dome decorated with Persian motifs, features religious frescoes and artworks honouring Christianity's Virgin Mary, the mother of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
