&lt;p&gt;By John Irish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) -France condemned on Thursday the lengthy prison sentencesgiven to two of its citizens for espionage, saying the charges were unfounded and the punishment arbitrary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecile Kohler and her partner Jacques Paris have been detained since 2022, among dozens of foreign and dual nationals held by Iran in recent years, often on spy-related charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rights groups and Western nations say they are being used as bargaining chips, which Iran denies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS (Reuters) -Greece said on Thursday it had agreed with Egypt on the future of St Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Egypt's Mount Sinai, one of the world's oldest sites of Christian worship whose status had led to a diplomatic spat between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athens had expressed concern about plans by Egypt to develop a tourism project around the site, where by Biblical tradition Moses received the Ten Commandments. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is still houses Greek Orthodox monks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ikram Aioua has seen her 12-year-old son rushed to the hospital three times in the past weeks for gas poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like thousands who have turned out to protest in her southern Tunisian city of Gabes, Aioua is demanding the closure of a nearby chemical factory, blaming it for a range of serious health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was in the classroom when I felt my throat burning and my head getting heavy, then I fainted," said Ahmed, Aioua's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The factory "is deadly poison", his 40-year-old mother cried. "It must be dismantled."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two agonising years of uncertainty following their son's abduction to Gaza, Israeli soldier Tamir Nimrodi's parents finally laid him to rest Thursday, after his body was returned under a ceasefire with Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nimrodi, 18 at the time of Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, was doing his military service at a base near the Erez Crossing into Gaza when he was seized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, he was one of the few hostages for whom no proof of life had been given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lives of a French couple held by Iran for more than three years who were this week handed lengthy jail sentences for espionage are at risk, their families warned Thursday, as France condemned their conviction on "baseless" charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecile Kohler, 41, and Jacques Paris, 72, were arrested in May 2022 and have been detained ever since. Their current location is unknown after they were moved from Tehran's Evin prison in the wake of the Israeli strike on the facility in the June war.&lt;/p&gt;
