Michael Georgy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 3 (Reuters) - Libya's Saif al-Islam Gaddafi went from his notorious father's heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before

sanctions-hit country to mark the occasion, while many public squares and bridges around Baghdad were decorated with coloured lights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State radio played endless songs to the glory of the ruthless national leader and callers were asked to recount improvised poems in his honour.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 07:00:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Pakistan
