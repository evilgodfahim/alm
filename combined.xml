end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For residents of the battered territory, daily life is a struggle for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Gaza's infrastructure lies in ruins, electricity remains scarce and hundreds of thousands of people live in makeshift tents after being repeatedly displaced by the two years of fighting that began with Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 11:00:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran prosecutor pledges 'decisive' response if protests destabilise

Saudi Arabia, but the incident has exposed simmering distrust between two Gulf oil powers with long-running differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airstrike by a Saudi-led coalition early on Tuesday on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla was followed by calls on all UAE forces to leave Yemen, and a statement from Riyadh that its national security was a red line.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue,
