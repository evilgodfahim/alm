Feb 6 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday that it hoped that negotiations between Iran and the United States in Oman would yield results and lead to a de-escalation and urged all sides to show restraint in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran and the United States started high-stakes negotiations on Friday to try to overcome sharp differences over Tehran's nuclear programme, with Oman shuttling between the sides, but a dispute over widening the agenda risked derailing diplomacy and triggering another Middle East conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 06

for militant groups in the region and its ballistic missile programme.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 09:00:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran, US to negotiate in Oman amid

such encounter between the two foes since the United States joined Israel's war against the Islamic republic in June with strikes on nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026
