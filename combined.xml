To avoid being sidelined in a fragmented global trading landscape, African governments must bargain collectively to negotiate deals with the US and strengthen ties with other emerging powers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:09:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Inflationary Tales</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/why-we-need-a-new-inflation-playbook-by-jonathan-levy-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/why-we-need-a-new-inflation-playbook-by-jonathan-levy-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The inflationary surge of the 1970s has long served as a cautionary tale, and that episode has shaped how central banks have carried out their mandates ever since. Two recent books revisit the standard narrative about that period in light of the 2021–23 inflation, offering sharply contrasting lessons for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:08:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Is Trump a State Capitalist?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/is-trump-a-state-capitalist</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/is-trump-a-state-capitalist</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While US President Donald Trump has embraced some elements of the free-market doctrine that dominated economic policymaking over the last century, he has also pursued an unprecedented level of state intervention in the US economy. With Trump’s “pay-to-play” approach to economic management seemingly combining the worst of both worlds, we asked &lt;em&gt;PS &lt;/em&gt;commentators how it might transform American capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 09:25:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Twilight of Pax Americana</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-tariffs-ignore-economic-realities-and-destroy-us-global-leadership-by-koichi-hamada-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-tariffs-ignore-economic-realities-and-destroy-us-global-leadership-by-koichi-hamada-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If Donald Trump continues to wield the threat of higher tariffs, he might be able to claim a few more “victories,” in the form of exploitative trade deals with longtime US allies and partners.
