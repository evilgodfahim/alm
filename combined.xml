&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) -The U.N. World Food Programme said on Friday it has brought about 560 tonnes of food per day on average into Gaza since the  Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect, but that still fell short of the scale of need in the enclave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With famine conditions present in parts of Gaza, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher said on Wednesday that thousands of aid vehicles would now have to enter Gaza weekly to ease the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's media regulator Ofcom said a BBC documentary about children's lives in Gaza narrated by the 13-year-old son of a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas-run government broke broadcasting rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the failure to disclose the position of the boy's father was "materially misleading".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC removed "Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone" from its online platform in February, five days after it was broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its own investigation found in July that the programme had breached its editorial guidelines on accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British authorities faced growing pressure Friday to overturn a ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending a European match at English club Aston Villa that Israel's government branded "shameful".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villa announced on Thursday that following advice from the police no away fans may attend the UEFA Europa League match with the Israeli club in Birmingham on November 6 due to "security concerns".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shameful decision! I call on the UK authorities to reverse this coward decision," the foreign minister of Israel Gideon Saar wrote in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;
