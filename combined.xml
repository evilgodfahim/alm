White House warned on Wednesday that Iran would be "wise" to do a deal with the United States as President Donald Trump once again hinted at military action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 20:00:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump to host Board of Peace meeting on Thursday, White House

director of the Berlin Film Festival on Wednesday rejected accusations from more than 80 film industry figures that the festival had helped censor artists who oppose Israel's actions in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an open letter published on Tuesday, Oscar-winning actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton were among dozens who criticised the Berlinale's "silence" on the issue and said they were "dismayed" at its "involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza".&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 18:30:20

Donald Trump give the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump -- who ordered strikes on Iran last year -- has repeatedly threatened Tehran with further military action if ongoing talks do not reach a

sparking some new crackdowns in an echo of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought down the U.S.-backed Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anti-Shah revolutionaries turned Shi'ite Muslim memorial
