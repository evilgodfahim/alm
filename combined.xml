&lt;p&gt;The United Nations on Wednesday said decades-long discrimination and segregation of Palestinians by Israel in the West Bank were intensifying, and called on the country to end its "apartheid system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new report, slammed by Israel, the UN rights office said "systematic discrimination" against Palestinians across the occupied Palestinian territories had "drastically deteriorated" in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a systematic asphyxiation of the rights of Palestinians in the West Bank," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Iran's top judge warned protesters on Wednesday there would be "no leniency for those who help the enemy against the Islamic Republic", while accusing Israel and the U.S. of pursuing hybrid methods to disrupt the country.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tehran is under international pressure with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to come to the aid of protesters if security forces fired on them, seven months after Israeli and U.S. forces bombed Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed not to "yield to the enemy".&lt;/p&gt;
