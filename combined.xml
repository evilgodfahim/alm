&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump warned Hamas Monday it would be "eradicated" if it breaches the Gaza deal with Israel, but said he would give the Palestinian militant group a chance to honor the truce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice President JD Vance headed to Israel shortly after Trump's comments, joining two top US envoys after weekend violence threatened to wreck the fragile ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We made a deal with Hamas that they're going to be very good, they're going to behave, they're going to be nice," Trump told reporters at the White House as he hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Gabriel Stargardter, Juliette Jabkhiro and Elissa Darwish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) -Crime gangs around Europe are increasingly robbing valuable jewels and gold from cash-needy museums like the Louvre, but while law enforcement often catches the thieves, they struggle to recover the priceless goods, police and art experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small pool of criminals would be capable of such a job as Sunday's audacious robbery in Paris and may already be known to police, the specialists say. But the objects themselves could be quickly broken down into component parts and sold on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran has scrapped a cooperation deal that it signed with the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA in September, its Supreme National Security Council Secretary said on Monday, according to state media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement came around three weeks after Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said Tehran would scrap the agreement, which let the IAEA resume inspections of its nuclear sites, if Western powers reinstated U.N. sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those were reinstated last month.&lt;/p&gt;
