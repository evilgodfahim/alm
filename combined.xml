countries, including many heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting in Washington, D.C., which Trump will chair on February 19, the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 18:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>In milestone, US pulls out of strategic Syria base and hands it over to

Feb 12 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump may be creating the conditions to reach a deal with Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu, in a statement before leaving Washington for Israel, said he had expressed "general scepticism" during his meeting with Trump and that if an agreement is indeed reached, it must include the elements that are very important to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include Iran's nuclear programme, its ballistic missiles and Iran’s proxies, he added.
