&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Numerous U.S. allies have said they would welcome the opportunity to go into Gaza and straighten out Hamas with "heavy force," but there is no need for that yet, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told these countries, and Israel, “NOT YET!” There is still hope that Hamas will do what is right. If they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, &amp;amp; BRUTAL! I would like to thank all of those countries that called to help," Trump wrote on Truth Social.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Susan Heavey)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) -The U.N. World Food Programme said on Tuesday that supplies into Gaza were ramping up after the U.S.-brokered ceasefire but were still far short of its daily target of 2,000 tons because only two crossings are open, and none to the famine-hit north of the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 750 metric tons of food are now entering the Gaza Strip daily, according to the WFP, but this was still well below the scale of needs after two years of conflict between Israel and Hamas that has reduced much of Gaza to a wasteland and made nearly its entire population homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Maayan Lubell and Nidal al-Mughrabi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM/CAIRO (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President JD Vance will arrive in Israel on Tuesday, as Washington tries to stabilise the first, shaky, phase of the Gaza ceasefire and push Israel and Hamas towards the harder concessions asked of each side in coming talks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides have accused each other of repeated breaches of the ceasefire since it was formally agreed eight days ago, with flashes of violence and recriminations over the pace of returning hostage bodies, bringing in aid and opening borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump threatened to "eradicate" Hamas if it breached its ceasefire deal with Israel, as Vice President JD Vance travelled to the region Tuesday to bolster the fragile Gaza truce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has redoubled its efforts to cement the fragile Gaza peace agreement it helped to broker, after Israel accused Hamas of stalling the hand-over of hostages' bodies and deadly violence flared up in the territory over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

But the objects themselves could be quickly broken down into component parts and sold on. &lt;/p&gt;
