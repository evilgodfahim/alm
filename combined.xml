&lt;p&gt;With replicas of missiles on display and effigies of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu hanging from a crane, thousands of Iranians commemorated on Tuesday the 1979 storming of the US embassy in Tehran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five months after a brief war with Israel that saw the US join in with strikes on key nuclear facilities, demonstrators chanted "Death to America, death to Israel!" and sang revolutionary songs in a particularly charged outing for the annual event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of visitors streamed through the Grand Egyptian Museum on Tuesday as almost the entire collection of King Tutankhamun's treasures -- over 4,500 artefacts -- was displayed together for the first time since the young pharaoh's tomb was discovered in 1922.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curated and conserved over nearly two decades, the collection was unveiled to the public two days after the museum's lavish opening ceremony on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick Cheney, who became one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history as George W. Bush’s number two during 9/11 and catastrophic wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, died Monday. He was 84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheney forged an influential role in the traditionally inconsequential job and was a major power behind the throne as Bush thrust America into the so-called war on terror, with a dark underbelly of renditions, torture and the Guantanamo prison site.&lt;/p&gt;
