&lt;p&gt;LISBON (Reuters) -Portugal's parliament approved on Friday a bill to ban face veils used for "gender or religious motives" in most public spaces that was proposed by the far-right Chega party and effectively targets burqas and niqabs worn by Muslim women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the bill, proposed fines for wearing face veils in public would range between 200 euros and 4,000 euros ($234-$4,671). Forcing someone to wear one would be punishable with prison terms of up to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face veils would still be allowed in aeroplanes, diplomatic premises and places of worship. &lt;/p&gt;

But further steps have been held up in part by Israeli accusations that the militants were too slow in handing over bodies of dead hostages. &lt;/p&gt;
