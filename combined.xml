&lt;p&gt;By Ahmed Elimam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) -Yemen's Houthis said on Thursday that their Chief of Staff Muhammad Abd Al-Karim al-Ghamari, one of the most senior military officials of the Iran-backed group, was killed "while fulfilling his duties".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without directly blaming Israel for his killing, Houthis said that the conflict with Israel had not ended. Israel will "receive its deterrent punishment for the crimes it has committed".&lt;/p&gt;

Security Council resolution in the coming days that would lay the foundation for a future international force in Gaza, France said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a shaky U.S.-mediated ceasefire between Israel and Hamas holding, planning has begun for an international force to stabilize security in the Palestinian enclave, two senior U.S. advisers said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fragile ceasefire holds, displaced Palestinian residents of Gaza City have returned to their homes only to find rubble, with many of them forced to camp out in makeshift shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the northwest of the city, empty streets are lined with piles of concrete that once were apartment buildings before the Israel-Hamas war, with some structures completely collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hossam Majed discovered his home reduced to rubble. Amid the ruins, the 31-year-old salvaged a few belongings, including some furniture and -- crucially given the shortages -- a large water tank.&lt;/p&gt;
