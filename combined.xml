accounting for Iran's enriched uranium stock is "long overdue".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IAEA's own guidelines stipulate that it should verify a country's stock of highly enriched uranium, such as the material enriched to up to 60% purity in Iran, a short step from the roughly 90% of weapons grade, every month.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 14:36:35
