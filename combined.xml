&lt;p&gt;By Parisa Hafezi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran's economy risks staggering into simultaneous hyperinflation and deep recession, officials and analysts say, as clerical rulers scramble to preserve stability with limited room to manoeuvre after a snapback of U.N. sanctions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They followed a breakdown in talks to curb Iran's disputed  nuclear activity and its ballistic missile programme. Diplomacy to resolve the deadlock remains possible, both sides say, though Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump's offer to forge a new deal.&lt;/p&gt;
