On Tuesday, he mocked the president in a Facebook post, describing him as the “supreme commander of sewage and rainwater drainage,” blasting what he said was the absence of any achievements by Saied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tarek Amara; editing by Mark Heinrich)&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 18:36:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Germany's Merz heads to Saudi, Gulf in quest for new partners</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/germanys-merz-heads-saudi-gulf-quest-new-partners</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/germanys-merz-heads-saudi-gulf-quest-new-partners</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;BERLIN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began a tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday aiming to forge energy and arms partnerships as Europe's biggest and richest economy sought to reduce dependence on the U.S. and China.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need such partnerships more than ever at a time when politics is increasingly being determined by major powers,"  Merz said at the start of his three-day trip, adding the aim of such alliances was to preserve freedom, security and prosperity.    &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 17:36:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Palestinians in Egypt torn on return to a Gaza with 'no future'</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/palestinians-egypt-torn-return-gaza-no-future</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/palestinians-egypt-torn-return-gaza-no-future</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As Israel begins to allow a trickle of Palestinians through the Rafah border crossing, Gazans stranded in Egypt are torn between staying in exile without formal status or returning to a land in ruins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Return to Gaza for what?
