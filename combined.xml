&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) -Syria hopes that U.S. sanctions against the country will be formally lifted in the coming months, the country's Economy Minister Mohammad Nidal al-Shaar told Reuters on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump ordered most sanctions lifted on the country in May after meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, but the Caesar Syria Civil Protection Act of 2019 authorising them remains U.S. law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) -The U.N. World Food Programme said on Tuesday that supplies into Gaza were ramping up after the U.S.-brokered ceasefire but were still far short of its daily target of 2,000 tons because only two crossings are open, and none to the famine-hit north of the enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 750 metric tons of food are now entering the Gaza Strip daily, according to the WFP, but this was still well below the scale of needs after two years of conflict between Israel and Hamas that has reduced much of Gaza to a wasteland and made nearly its entire population homeless.&lt;/p&gt;

By persuading Hamas to accept Donald Trumpâ€™s Gaza deal, Ankara has reasserted itself on the Middle East chessboard, to the dismay of Israel and Arab rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially resistant to the U.S. president's ultimatum -- free the Israeli hostages or face continued devastation -- Hamas leaders relented only when Turkey, a country they view as a political patron, urged them to agree to the American plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump warned Hamas Monday it would be "eradicated" if it breaches the Gaza deal with Israel, but said he would give the Palestinian militant group a chance to honor the truce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice President JD Vance headed to Israel shortly after Trump's comments, joining two top US envoys after weekend violence threatened to wreck the fragile ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We made a deal with Hamas that they're going to be very good, they're going to behave, they're going to be nice," Trump told reporters at the White House as he hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Gabriel Stargardter, Juliette Jabkhiro and Elissa Darwish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) -Crime gangs around Europe are increasingly robbing valuable jewels and gold from cash-needy museums like the Louvre, but while law enforcement often catches the thieves, they struggle to recover the priceless goods, police and art experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small pool of criminals would be capable of such a job as Sunday's audacious robbery in Paris and may already be known to police, the specialists say. But the objects themselves could be quickly broken down into component parts and sold on. &lt;/p&gt;
