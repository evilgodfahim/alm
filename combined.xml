&lt;p&gt;By Steven Scheer and Pesha Magid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to urge Israel to release popular Palestinian political figure Marwan Barghouti, jailed for more than 20 years and repeatedly denied his freedom by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am literally being confronted with that question about 15 minutes before you called," Trump told Time in an interview published on Thursday. "That was the question. That was my question of the day. So I'll be making a decision."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Emma Farge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) -Clearing the surface of Gaza of unexploded ordnance will likely take between 20 to 30 years, according to an official with aid group Humanity &amp;amp; Inclusion, describing the enclave as a "horrific, unmapped minefield".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 53 people have been killed and hundreds injured by lethal remnants from the two-year Israel-Hamas war, according to a U.N.-led database, which is thought by aid groups to be a huge underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization said Thursday there had been little improvement in the amount of aid going into Gaza since a ceasefire took hold -- and no observable reduction in hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The situation still remains catastrophic because what's entering is not enough," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online press briefing from the UN health agency's Geneva headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect on October 10, there has been "no dent in hunger, because there is not enough food", he warned.&lt;/p&gt;
