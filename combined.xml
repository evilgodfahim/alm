ousted the shah. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 03:30:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Australian writers festival in turmoil over decision to bar Palestinian

10 days since Trump said the United States was "locked and loaded" and ready to "come to the rescue" if Iran's clerical state kills demonstrators who have taken to the streets in major numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Trump has kept threatening a military option, even as hundreds of people have died, according to rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026

other countries, including Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, described the nationwide protests gripping Iran as an "uprising".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the unrest showed that Russia had to rethink its close links with Iran, which have included its wide use of Iranian-made "Shahed" drones in the nearly four-year-old war against
