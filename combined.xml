&lt;p&gt;The Israeli military said Tuesday that the remains of four deceased hostages returned by Hamas have been identified, including those of a Nepalese student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, a Gaza hospital said it has received the bodies of 45 Palestinians that had been handed back by Israel, also as part of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Israeli military named two of the victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) -The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will stay closed through Wednesday and the flow of aid into the Palestinian enclave will be reduced, three Israeli officials said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision came after Palestinian militant group Hamas did not hand over bodies of hostages it is holding as part of the new U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, the officials said, without elaborating on how long the move would last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran's foreign ministry on Tuesday criticised U.S. President Donald Trump's call for dialogue, accusing Washington of "hostile and criminal behaviour" after his remarks to Israel's parliament about being ready to strike a deal with Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry said in a statement that Trump's call for peace is in conflict with his actions towards Iran. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Trump can either be a President of Peace or a President of War, but he cannot be both at the same time," Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in a separate comment on X on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
