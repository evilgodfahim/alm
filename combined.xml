&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday that he wrote to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to resolve a long-running tussle over who will host next year's COP31 summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia and Turkey submitted bids in 2022 to host the United Nations climate conference and both countries have refused to concede to the other ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked on Sunday if he thought Australia would end up as host, Albanese said: "There's no real process for finalising the matter. I've written to President Erdogan of Türkiye, we're continuing to engage."&lt;/p&gt;
