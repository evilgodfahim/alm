For India today, this means preventing escalation with China without succumbing to the illusion of partnership, and negotiating firmly with the US without disrupting constructive engagement.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 16:00:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Africa’s Rare-Earth Opportunity</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/africa-critical-mineral-deals-must-not-perpetuate-the-resource-curse-by-kingsley-moghalu-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/africa-critical-mineral-deals-must-not-perpetuate-the-resource-curse-by-kingsley-moghalu-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As global demand for critical minerals surges, Africa has a once-in-a-century opportunity to break the “resource curse” and convert its vast natural wealth into economic and social transformation.
