President Donald Trump headed home from Davos on Thursday after unveiling his new Board of Peace and once again casting himself as a global peacemaker, despite widespread scepticism over a plan that aims to rewrite the world order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump officials also unveiled ambitious plans for a "New Gaza" during the ceremony at the World Economic Forum, with the US leader describing the devastated Palestinian territory as "great real estate".&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:30:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iraq to prosecute ISIS detainees transferred from

push to reassert central authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spilled into conflict this month as the SDF resisted government demands for its fighters and enclaves to be integrated into the state.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:36:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Putin offers

Jan 22 (Reuters) - Spain's High Court on Thursday closed its investigation into the use of Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group's "Pegasus" software to spy on Spanish politicians, citing a lack of cooperation from Israeli authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was launched after the Spanish government disclosed in 2022 that NSO's spyware had been used to spy on members of the

scratch to include residential towers, data centres and seaside resorts, part of President Donald Trump's push to advance an Israel-Hamas ceasefire shaken by repeated violations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Gaza Strip, health officials said Israeli airstrikes on Thursday had killed five people in the enclave.
