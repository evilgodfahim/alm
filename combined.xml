20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is set to be briefed by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that any expansion of Iran's ballistic missile program poses a threat that could necessitate swift action, NBC News reported on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli officials are concerned that Iran is reconstituting nuclear enrichment sites the U.S. bombed in June, and are preparing to brief Trump for options on attacking the missile program again, the NBC report added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not verify the report.
