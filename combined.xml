Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets will arrive in the Middle East region in the coming days, two U.S. officials said on Thursday, even as U.S. President Donald Trump voices hopes of avoiding new military action against Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. warships including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, several destroyers and fighter aircraft started moving from the Asia-Pacific last week as tensions between Iran and the United States soared following a severe crackdown on protests across Iran in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:36:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>With 'Board of Peace,' Trump tries hand at institution-making, to wide

a year of tearing down global norms and withdrawing from UN bodies, US President Donald Trump is trying his hand at international institution building with his self-styled "Board of Peace" -- to wide skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United Nations, where every member has a say and five big powers wield vetoes, the nascent board is unambiguously led not just by the United States but personally by Trump, who will hold final say and can remain in charge past his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:00:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Gazans pay

push to reassert central authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spilled into conflict this month as the

Jan 22 (Reuters) - Spain's High Court on Thursday closed its investigation into the use of Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group's "Pegasus" software to spy on Spanish politicians, citing a lack of cooperation from Israeli authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was launched after the Spanish government disclosed in 2022 that NSO's spyware had been used to spy on members of the

scratch to include residential towers, data centres and seaside resorts, part of President Donald Trump's push to advance an Israel-Hamas ceasefire shaken by repeated violations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Gaza Strip, health officials said Israeli airstrikes on Thursday had killed five people in the enclave. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the violence, the latest to fray the October truce accord. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:36:41 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
