&lt;p&gt;A landmark 10-year deal world powers signed with Iran to rein in its nuclear programme officially ends Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deal began to fall apart years ago, and wide-ranging UN sanctions were reimposed last month on the Islamic republic, effectively burying the agreement but creating space for something new, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- What does 'Termination Day' mean? -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal's "termination day" was set for October 18, 2025, exactly 10 years after the adoption of resolution 2231, with which the UN Security Council enshrined it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LISBON (Reuters) -Portugal's parliament approved on Friday a bill to ban face veils used for "gender or religious motives" in most public spaces that was proposed by the far-right Chega party and effectively targets burqas and niqabs worn by Muslim women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the bill, proposed fines for wearing face veils in public would range between 200 euros and 4,000 euros ($234-$4,671). Forcing someone to wear one would be punishable with prison terms of up to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face veils would still be allowed in aeroplanes, diplomatic premises and places of worship. &lt;/p&gt;
