&lt;p&gt;Crowds of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank town of Silwad attended the funeral of a 15-year-old boy on Friday after he was shot dead by Israeli forces overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 200 mourners clapped and chanted as they carried the body of Yamen Hamed, wrapped in a Palestinian flag, through the crowded streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some waved Palestinian flags, while others clutched those representing the Islamist movement Hamas and its longtime rival Fatah -- the party of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.Inside, women sobbed over the teenager's body, stroking and kissing his face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Timour Azhari&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAMASCUS (Reuters) -"I didn't know the salaries the government pays were this high!" Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa joked after more than 100 loyalists arrived at his former rebel base, many pulling up in luxury SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Have you forgotten you are the sons of the revolution?" Sharaa rebuked the gathered officials and business leaders, according to two people present, remarking upon the large number of Cadillac Escalades, Range Rovers and Chevrolet Tahoes parked outside. "Have you been tempted so quickly?" &lt;/p&gt;
