&lt;p&gt;Iran has released from prison a French pair held for more than three years and sentenced to lengthy jail sentences on espionage charges their families always rejected, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cecile Kohler, 41, and Jacques Paris, 72 -- she a high school teacher, he a retired teacher, both on a tourist visit to Iran when they were arrested in May 2022 -- are now "on their way to the French embassy in Tehran", Macron said on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He welcomed this "first step" and said talks were underway to ensure their return to France as "quickly as possible".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick Cheney achieved influence unrivaled for a vice president in shaping US foreign policy, ruthlessly pursuing military might and advocating pre-emptive war to reshape the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The descent of Cheney, who died Tuesday, was also spectacular. His hawkish brand of neoconservatism, including the invasion of Iraq, began to be repudiated even before he left office, and today both major US parties largely reject his views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Olivia Le Poidevin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAIRO/GENEVA (Reuters) -Far too little aid is reaching Gaza nearly four weeks after a ceasefire, humanitarian agencies said on Tuesday, as hunger persists with winter approaching and old tents start to fray following Israel's devastating two-year offensive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truce was meant to unleash a torrent of aid across the tiny, crowded enclave where famine was confirmed in August and where almost all the 2.3 million inhabitants have lost their homes to Israeli bombardment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick Cheney, who became one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history as George W. Bush’s number two during 9/11 and catastrophic wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, died Monday. He was 84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheney forged an influential role in the traditionally inconsequential job and was a major power behind the throne as Bush thrust America into the so-called war on terror, with a dark underbelly of renditions, torture and the Guantanamo prison site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Timour Azhari&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has cast himself as the leader who can finally make the country a success after years of instability, and has moved against established parties that brought him to power as he seeks a second term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by signs of rising public support ahead of a November 11 parliamentary election, an increasingly confident Sudani is running against key members of a grouping of parties and armed groups that originally tapped him for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
