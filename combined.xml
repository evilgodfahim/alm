&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump's lightning summit in Egypt, meant to cement a ceasefire in Gaza, was more a celebration of one man's newfound peacemaker persona than a high-level political negotiation, according to diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey -- guarantors to the Israel-Hamas deal -- signed a document on Monday that one diplomat called "more of a vision statement than anything".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In devastated Gaza, the ceasefire is mostly holding, but most of the details of Trump's 20-point peace plan have yet to be thrashed out.&lt;/p&gt;
