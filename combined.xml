Bush -- still divides the country. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:30:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Lebanese army feeling US, Israeli heat over Hezbollah disarmament</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/lebanese-army-feeling-us-israeli-heat-over-hezbollah-disarmament</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/lebanese-army-feeling-us-israeli-heat-over-hezbollah-disarmament</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Israeli and US pressure on Lebanon's army to speedily disarm militant group Hezbollah is intensifying, with the army chief cancelling a visit to Washington after officials snubbed him, a military official told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lebanon's army has been beefing up its presence in south Lebanon near the Israeli border since a US-brokered ceasefire last November sought to end more than a year of hostilities between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:30:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran stops IAEA inspections following UN watchdog's reprimand</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/iran-stops-iaea-inspections-following-un-watchdogs-reprimand</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/iran-stops-iaea-inspections-following-un-watchdogs-reprimand</guid><description>The IAEA Board of Governors approved a resolution on Thursday demanding Iran provide access to attacked nuclear facilities and information on its uranium stockpiles.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:35:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran stops IAEA inspections following UN watchdog's reprimand</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/iran-stops-iaea-inspections-following-un-watchdogs-reprimand</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/iran-stops-iaea-inspections-following-un-watchdogs-reprimand</guid><description>The IAEA Board of Governors approved a resolution on Thursday demanding Iran provide access to attacked nuclear facilities and information on its uranium stockpiles.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:35:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran stops IAEA inspections following UN watchdog's reprimand</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/iran-stops-iaea-inspections-following-un-watchdogs-reprimand</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/iran-stops-iaea-inspections-following-un-watchdogs-reprimand</guid><description>The IAEA Board of Governors approved a resolution on Thursday demanding Iran provide access to attacked nuclear facilities and information on its uranium stockpiles.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:35:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran stops IAEA inspections following UN watchdog's reprimand</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/iran-stops-iaea-inspections-following-un-watchdogs-reprimand</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/iran-stops-iaea-inspections-following-un-watchdogs-reprimand</guid><description>The IAEA Board of Governors approved a resolution on Thursday demanding Iran provide access to attacked nuclear facilities and information on its uranium stockpiles.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:35:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UN nuclear watchdog demands Iran open up bombed nuclear sites</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/un-nuclear-watchdog-demands-iran-open-bombed-nuclear-sites</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/un-nuclear-watchdog-demands-iran-open-bombed-nuclear-sites</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency board on Thursday passed a resolution demanding that Iran provide "full and prompt" cooperation including access to sensitive nuclear sites, but Tehran immediately rejected the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-simmering tensions with the UN nuclear watchdog flared anew after Israeli and US strikes on Iranian sites in June.

on aspects of Iran's nuclear programme but it also stated Iran must quickly provide the IAEA with the answers and access it wants, five months after military strikes by Israel and the U.S.
