&lt;p&gt;By Bhargav Acharya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) -The U.S. military's Middle East command on Wednesday called on Hamas to stop its violence against civilians in Gaza and disarm "without delay" as the militant group reasserts itself by deploying security forces and executing those it deems collaborators with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas, which has not publicly committed to disarming and cedingpower, has gradually sent its men back into the streets of Gaza since the ceasefire began on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
