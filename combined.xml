The targeting of vessels in our Exclusive Economic Zone on Friday signals a worrying escalation," Erdogan told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:01:38

Dec 1 (Reuters) - Dublin City Council has delayed a decision on whether to remove the name of a former Israeli president from a park amid a heated debate on whether the change would be justified or would represent an attack on the area's Jewish community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the move say the name of Chaim Herzog, who was raised in Dublin and served as president of Israel from 1983 to 1993, should be removed as an act of solidarity with Palestinians, citing Herzog's time in Israeli military intelligence and as military governor of the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon,

AVIV, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared in court on Monday for the first time since asking the country's president for a pardon in his long-running corruption trial, a move backed by close ally U.S. President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition politicians have come out against the request, with some arguing that any pardon should be conditional on Netanyahu retiring from politics and admitting guilt. Others have said the prime minister must first call national elections, which are due by October 2026, before requesting any pardon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 12:01:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Explainer-Netanyahu's corruption trial divides Israeli public</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/12/explainer-netanyahus-corruption-trial-divides-israeli-public</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/12/explainer-netanyahus-corruption-trial-divides-israeli-public</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Dec 1 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand on Monday for the first time since asking the country's president for a pardon in his long-running corruption trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is what you need to know about the charges that have divided the Israeli public at a time of Middle East turmoil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT ARE THE CHARGES?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - all of which Netanyahu denies.
