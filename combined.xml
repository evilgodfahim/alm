If his show of cracking down on crime were based on the evidence, he would be focusing on the rural counties where many of his voters live.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 15:30:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Peacemaker Hype</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-absurd-unga-claim-to-have-ended-seven-wars-in-seven-months-by-brahma-chellaney-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-absurd-unga-claim-to-have-ended-seven-wars-in-seven-months-by-brahma-chellaney-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize campaign – which he recently took to the United Nations General Assembly – has followed a familiar pattern: invent or inflate a problem, claim to have solved it, and then demand a reward. The Norwegian Nobel Committee will not be fooled, but the same cannot be said for Trump’s base.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 15:02:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Building a Global Order that Works for Africa</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/africa-must-build-new-multilateral-system-that-reflects-its-priorities-needs-by-martha-bekele-and-arthur-larok-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/africa-must-build-new-multilateral-system-that-reflects-its-priorities-needs-by-martha-bekele-and-arthur-larok-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Africa’s underdevelopment can be largely attributed to its integration into the world economy through the slave trade, colonialism, and now debt-fueled neoliberalism. The continent’s leaders must dare to imagine a new multilateral system that values people over profit, care over competition, and collective dignity over extractive growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 14:31:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Are MAGA Voters Rational?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-do-trump-supporters-vote-against-their-economic-interests-by-jeffrey-frankel-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-do-trump-supporters-vote-against-their-economic-interests-by-jeffrey-frankel-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Since the study of economics relies on the assumption that people largely act in their rational self-interest, when people vote otherwise, economists are likely to blame faulty or missing information.

The app's owner, ByteDance, will no longer oversee daily content recommendations, but China will still have residual control over the platform's algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 11:41:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>“America First” Accounting Standards?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sec-threatening-international-accounting-standards-rule-by-howard-davies-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sec-threatening-international-accounting-standards-rule-by-howard-davies-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s new SEC chairman has threatened to require foreign companies listed in the US to reconcile their international-standards-based reporting with US reporting principles.

Rather than wait around hoping for the US to re-embrace reason, democratic values, and global leadership, the “rest of the West” must step up to preserve the foundations of global stability and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:08:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China Plans, America Reacts</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reactive-industrial-policy-cannot-compare-to-china-five-year-plans-by-stephen-s-roach-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reactive-industrial-policy-cannot-compare-to-china-five-year-plans-by-stephen-s-roach-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s transactional strain of industrial policy has prompted many to ask whether he has embraced Chinese-style state capitalism. But Trumponomics, lacking an overarching strategy and largely based on the whims of one man, is nothing like China’s comprehensive “all-of-government” approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 13:23:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Robert Redford and the Leadership America Has Lost</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-redford-and-the-civic-political-leadership-america-has-lost-by-carla-norrlof-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-redford-and-the-civic-political-leadership-america-has-lost-by-carla-norrlof-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Through his films, conservation efforts, and the Sundance festival, Robert Redford enjoyed global fame for most of his adult life.
