About 6,000 foreigners are housed in al-Hol and a further 2,000 in Roj. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A charity that has worked in both camps, the Swiss-based Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, told Reuters it understands Damascus aims to empty and shut the sites within a year.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:36:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says Iran wants deal, US 'armada' larger than in Venezuela raid</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/01/trump-says-iran-wants-deal-us-armada-larger-venezuela-raid</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/01/trump-says-iran-wants-deal-us-armada-larger-venezuela-raid</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump said Thursday he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal to avoid military action, adding that the US "armada" near Iran was bigger than the one he dispatched to topple Venezuela's leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a large armada, flotilla, call it whatever you want, heading toward Iran right now, even larger than what we had in Venezuela," the Republican president told reporters in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hopefully we'll make a deal.

President Donald Trump has threatened military action against Iran over its crackdown on protesters, while still for now appearing to leave the door open for negotiations over the Islamic republic's controversial nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But should Trump, after weeks of American threats and counter-threats from Tehran, finally decide to order military action after already sending a US aircraft carrier to the region, he faces another dilemma over what form the intervention should take.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:30:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syria

government and Kurdish forces reached a comprehensive deal on Friday to gradually integrate the Kurds' military and civilian institutions into the state, a step Washington described as a "historic milestone".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have ceded vast areas of Arab-majority land to government forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was territory they held for years, having seized it in fierce battles against the Islamic State jihadist group during a campaign backed by a US-led coalition.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:00:20

Africa ordered Israel's top diplomat to leave the country within 72 hours on Friday, citing a "series of violations" and prompting the Israeli government to expel Pretoria's own diplomatic representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ties between the nations are already strained by South Africa's case before the United Nations top court in 2023 to argue that Israel's war on Gaza amounts to genocide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South African foreign ministry said it had informed Israel that its charge d'affaires, Ariel Seidman, was "persona non grata" and "required to depart from the Republic within 72 hours".&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 16:30:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iraqi militias claim volunteers readying to defend Iran from US: What to
