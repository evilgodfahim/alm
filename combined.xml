In this sense, the tariffs almost seem to be deliberately designed to impede development and exacerbate global inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2025 10:01:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Fighting Poverty Must Not Stop</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/innnovative-finance-could-hold-key-to-lifting-millions-out-of-poverty-by-akinwumi-a-adesina-and-ilan-goldfajn-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/innnovative-finance-could-hold-key-to-lifting-millions-out-of-poverty-by-akinwumi-a-adesina-and-ilan-goldfajn-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Reducing poverty fuels growth, bolsters resilience, and fosters stability, making it essential to long-term development.
