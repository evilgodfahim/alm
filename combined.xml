Tarek Amara&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TUNIS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Tunisian President Kais Saied's ​supporters rallied in the capital on ​Wednesday calling the opposition "traitors", following mounting street protests in recent ⁠weeks that have highlighted widening political divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rival rallies come amid a deepening economic crisis marked by high inflation, ​shortages of some basic goods and poor public ‍services, which have fuelled public ​anger. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:01:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Factbox-What is Islamic State,

​inspire the gunmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men accused of carrying out Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years had spent time in the Philippines, ⁠where Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT IS ISLAMIC STATE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sunni Muslim group emerged in Iraq and Syria and quickly created a "caliphate", declaring its rule over all Muslims and

Byron Kaye&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Dec 17 (Reuters) - After Australia's deadliest mass shooting in 1996, the country rushed in some of the world's toughest gun laws, including mandatory licensing and background checks, as well as registration of ​every firearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a winding back of those laws, failure to update them with the internet age and growing ​complacency with background checks may have made it easier for two suspects behind Sunday's shooting during a Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach to acquire weapons, gun safety experts said.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 06:36:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Australia police charge alleged Bondi Beach gunman with 59 offences, including
