Andrea Mandala&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MILAN, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Italy's state broadcaster RAI was forced to apologise to the Jewish community on Saturday after an off‑air remark advising its producers to "avoid" the Israeli crew was broadcast before coverage of the Four-Man bobsleigh event at the Winter Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of RAI's sports division had already resigned earlier in the week after his error-ridden commentary at the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony two weeks ago triggered a revolt among its journalists.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 18:36:40

Feb 21 (Reuters) - Students held protests at several Iranian universities at the start of a new semester on Saturday, some clashing with pro-government groups, according to local news agencies and posts on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protests coincided with ceremonies traditionally held after 40 days to mourn those killed by security forces during last month's anti-government demonstrations, which saw thousands lose their lives in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 17:36:39

saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same press conference he had said that films had the power to "change the world" but in a different way from
