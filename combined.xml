Security Council on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the unrest against clerical rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 21:36:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syrian activist Sarah Mardini acquitted of migrant trafficking in

Iran over Tehran's use of force against protesters that they feared would have impacts across the region, a Gulf official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt were involved in the diplomacy over 48 hours before U.S. President Donald Trump signalled on Thursday that he had ultimately decided against an attack for now, saying the killings in Iran were
