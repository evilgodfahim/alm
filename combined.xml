&lt;p&gt;Months after returning from the frontline in Gaza, Israeli army captain Israel Ben Shitrit says he is still haunted by the ghosts of the war he left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The scream of the soldier asking for rescue... no matter where I am, I will always hear that scream," he told AFP, speaking of a comrade he had been unable to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Shitrit was himself seriously wounded in combat in early 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His testimony comes as Israel faces a wave of suicides among troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the wake of several conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) -Australia's statements about an incident involving Chinese military aircraft over the South China Sea are an attempt to cover up an Australian "intrusion" into Chinese airspace, the Chinese defence ministry said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry has complained to Canberra about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry was referring to an incident around the Paracel Islands in which Australia claimed a Chinese fighter jet dropped flares near one of its maritime patrol planes. Australia called the incident "unsafe and unprofessional".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Parisa Hafezi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran's economy risks staggering into simultaneous hyperinflation and deep recession, officials and analysts say, as clerical rulers scramble to preserve stability with limited room to manoeuvre after a snapback of U.N. sanctions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They followed a breakdown in talks to curb Iran's disputed  nuclear activity and its ballistic missile programme. Diplomacy to resolve the deadlock remains possible, both sides say, though Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump's offer to forge a new deal.&lt;/p&gt;
