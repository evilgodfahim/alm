Ramadan lanterns and string lights appeared on streets lined with collapsed buildings and piles of rubble in Gaza City, bringing joy and respite as Islam's holiest month began -- the first since

(PKK). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the PKK formally renounced its armed struggle against Turkey after four decades of violence that claimed some 50,000 lives on both sides.
