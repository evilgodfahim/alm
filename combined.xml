To focus exclusively on identity – on race and gender – while ignoring the material reality of class and repudiating the working class itself, is a catastrophic strategic error.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 09:30:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Asia Can Reduce Its Dollar Dependence</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/asian-policymakers-must-focus-on-managing-vulnerabilities-not-displacing-dollar-by-yasuto-watanabe-and-hiro-ito-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/asian-policymakers-must-focus-on-managing-vulnerabilities-not-displacing-dollar-by-yasuto-watanabe-and-hiro-ito-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite heightened geopolitical tensions and escalating trade wars, the US dollar’s global dominance is unlikely to fade in the near term. This leaves Asian economies vulnerable to dollar shocks, underscoring the need for deeper regional cooperation and stronger financial safety nets.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 08:35:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>On Climate Change, Capital Must Follow Africa’s Lead</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-investors-can-support-africa-clean-energy-transition-by-georgia-levenson-keohane-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-investors-can-support-africa-clean-energy-transition-by-georgia-levenson-keohane-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With its vast solar resources and rapidly growing population, Africa has the potential to achieve a green transition that delivers sustainable and inclusive growth. But achieving this will require closing a $2.8 trillion financing shortfall by mobilizing international capital for African-led initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 16:00:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A New Paradigm for Financing Education</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/education-financing-as-a-core-component-of-economic-development-by-bola-ahmed-tinubu-and-jakaya-kikwete-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/education-financing-as-a-core-component-of-economic-development-by-bola-ahmed-tinubu-and-jakaya-kikwete-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to replenishing global financial support for education, developing countries also need a new strategy to establish self-sustaining education systems that can deliver consistent quality for all children.

At the heart of this shift is China, whose massive push into green manufacturing could accelerate the clean-energy transition and consolidate its industrial dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 12:54:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Money Will Not Be Revolutionized</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/future-of-money-cbdc-stablecoins-tokenized-assets-no-bitcoin-revolution-by-nouriel-roubini-and-brunello-rosa-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/future-of-money-cbdc-stablecoins-tokenized-assets-no-bitcoin-revolution-by-nouriel-roubini-and-brunello-rosa-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The future of money and payment systems will be characterized by evolution, not some radical crypto revolution of the kind envisioned by Bitcoin advocates.

In fact, with its vast population and robust domestic demand, India is better positioned than most to withstand external shocks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:59:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Do or Die for the United Nations</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-nations-must-adapt-or-die-by-adekeye-adebajo-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-nations-must-adapt-or-die-by-adekeye-adebajo-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With US President Donald Trump blithely brushing aside the United Nations’ many achievements, it is worth revisiting the organization’s successes and failures over the years. While it is obvious that the world’s premier multilateral body must reform, it is equally obvious that we would all be worse off without it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:26:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>United States, Inc.</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/united-states-inc</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/united-states-inc</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From “transactional” trade deals and “efficiency” drives to pay-to-play immigration policies, Donald Trump appears determined to govern the United States like a business. But a profit-seeking government will never provide an adequate supply of public goods, and the lawless version pursued by Trump, a serial bankrupt, is poorly suited to anything other than self-enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:00:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Picture</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-states-inc-doc-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-states-inc-doc-2025-09</guid><description></description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 15:59:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Are US Democrats Really Soft on Crime?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-national-guard-deployments-ignore-republican-city-high-crime-rates-by-ian-ayres-and-jacob-slaughter-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-national-guard-deployments-ignore-republican-city-high-crime-rates-by-ian-ayres-and-jacob-slaughter-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While US President Donald Trump deploys National Guard troops to major cities governed by Democrats, the data show that violent crime rates are actually much higher elsewhere.

The app's owner, ByteDance, will no longer oversee daily content recommendations, but China will still have residual control over the platform's algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 11:41:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>“America First” Accounting Standards?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sec-threatening-international-accounting-standards-rule-by-howard-davies-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sec-threatening-international-accounting-standards-rule-by-howard-davies-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s new SEC chairman has threatened to require foreign companies listed in the US to reconcile their international-standards-based reporting with US reporting principles.
