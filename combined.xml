group of journalists in ​Lebanon, killing a Reuters correspondent and wounding others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Peter Welch from Vermont, the home state of one of the journalists wounded in the ⁠attack, accused Israel of not conducting a serious investigation into the incident, saying he had seen no proof of that. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:36:48
