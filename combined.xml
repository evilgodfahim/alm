In fact, persistently high fertility often exacerbates underemployment, limits investment in education and infrastructure, and entrenches poverty across generations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 09:38:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Kazakhstan’s Digital Crossroad</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/kazakhstan-digital-ambitions-face-political-regulatory-barriers-by-nowmay-opalinski-and-romain-fontugne-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/kazakhstan-digital-ambitions-face-political-regulatory-barriers-by-nowmay-opalinski-and-romain-fontugne-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To reduce its reliance on Russia’s internet ecosystem, Kazakhstan has invested significant sums in upgrading its infrastructure and developing international transit capabilities.
