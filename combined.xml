&lt;p&gt;Turkey's military is ready to "support" Syria in its battle with Kurdish fighters in the northwestern city of Aleppo if Damascus asks for help, a defence ministry official said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Turkey's top diplomat said Ankara had been working "intensively" with Syrian and American officials in a bid to end the unrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly clashes erupted this week between Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) after the two sides failed to reach a year-end deadline to merge the Kurdish fighters into the main Damascus military. &lt;/p&gt;

Its operations command announced a curfew in the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh from 3 p.m. (1200 GMT).    &lt;/p&gt;
