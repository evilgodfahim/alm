(Reuters) -President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that Turkey believes the most realistic way to resolve political deadlock over Cyprus is to have two states on the ethnically-split island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erdogan was speaking alongside Tufan Erhurman, the newly-elected Turkish Cypriot president who has pledged to explore a federal solution - long supported by the United Nations - to end the island's nearly 50-year-old division.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:36:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Migrant arrivals in Spain's Balearics surge as

in January-October compared with the same period last year, the steepest increase among routes, even as overall arrivals to the EU fell 22%, according to data from EU border agency Frontex.
