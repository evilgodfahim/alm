&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) -Hamas called on mediators on Friday to push for the next steps under the ceasefire in Gaza, including reopening the border, letting in aid, beginning reconstruction, setting up an administration and completing Israel's withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting has largely stopped in Gaza under U.S. President Donald Trump's plan, endorsed by mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. But further steps have been held up in part by Israeli accusations that the militants were too slow in handing over bodies of dead hostages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PESHAWAR (Reuters) -Seven Pakistani soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near the Afghanistan border on Friday, Pakistani security officials said, as a temporary truce that paused days of intense fighting between the neighbours ended without any word on its extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Asian neighbours engaged in fierce ground fighting, and Pakistan also launched airstrikes across their contested frontier, killing dozens and wounding hundreds, before they reached a 48-hour truce that ended at 1300 GMT on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
