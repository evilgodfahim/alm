&lt;p&gt;By Bhargav Acharya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) -The U.S. military's Middle East command on Wednesday called on Hamas to stop its violence against civilians in Gaza and disarm "without delay" as the militant group reasserts itself by deploying security forces and executing those it deems collaborators with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas, which has not publicly committed to disarming and cedingpower, has gradually sent its men back into the streets of Gaza since the ceasefire began on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said Wednesday he wanted to "redefine" relations with Moscow as Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted him in their first meeting since key Kremlin ally Bashar al-Assad was ousted last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In front of the television cameras, Putin greeted Sharaa warmly at the Kremlin, but behind closed doors the Syrian leader was expected to push for Moscow to extradite Assad, who fled there after being toppled.&lt;/p&gt;
