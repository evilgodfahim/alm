Its reopening comes as a relief to Palestinians who want to leave Gaza for medical care or those who want to return after fleeing the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are details about Rafah as well as the coastal enclave's crossings with Israel. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:01:44 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
