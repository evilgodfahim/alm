Jan 23 (Reuters) - Spain will not take part in the Board of Peace initiative launched by U.S. President Donald Trump to tackle global conflicts, saying the decision was consistent with its belief in multilateralism and the United Nations system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We appreciate the invitation, but we decline," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters late on Thursday after an EU summit in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 08:36:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump revokes Canada's invitation to join Board of

Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets will arrive in the Middle East region in the coming days, two U.S. officials said on Thursday, even as U.S. President Donald Trump voices hopes of avoiding new military action against Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. warships including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, several destroyers and fighter aircraft started moving from the Asia-Pacific last week as tensions between Iran and the United States soared following a severe crackdown on protests across Iran in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:36:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Egypt's economy can weather more Red Sea attacks, says finance

a year of tearing down global norms and withdrawing from UN bodies, US President Donald Trump is trying his hand at international institution building with his self-styled "Board of Peace" -- to wide skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the United Nations, where every member has a say and five big powers wield vetoes, the nascent board is unambiguously led not just by the United States but personally by Trump, who will hold final say and can remain in charge past his presidency.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:00:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Gazans pay
