Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in Berlin after talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said Turkey's position on Cyprus was an obstacle to its EU ambitions. He also argued that Ankara should not gain access to the bloc's defence fund, known as SAFE, saying that Turkey - though a NATO member - has no defence or security agreement with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Palestinians return for prayers in West Bank mosque after settler attack</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/palestinians-return-prayers-west-bank-mosque-after-settler-attack</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/palestinians-return-prayers-west-bank-mosque-after-settler-attack</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Palestinians in a village in the Israeli-occupied West Bank held weekly communal prayers on Friday after clearing insulting graffiti, broken glass and burn marks from a mosque they say was targeted by Jewish settlers amid a spike in attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villagers in Deir Istiya who cleaned up the mosque told Reuters that settlers had smashed windows, sprayed slogans insulting Islam's Prophet Mohammed and tried to torch the building in an assault on Wednesday night. &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Water shortage pushes Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan into energy crisis</title><link>https://archive.is/o/11Q8k/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/water-shortage-pushes-kyrgyzstan-tajikistan-energy-crisis</link><guid>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/11/water-shortage-pushes-kyrgyzstan-tajikistan-energy-crisis</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are facing an energy crisis as water levels have plummeted at the reservoirs powering their largests hydropower stations, officials said this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two landlocked Central Asian countries are heavily reliant on hydropower.
