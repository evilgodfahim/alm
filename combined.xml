The finance ministers and central bankers attending the IMF and World Bank's annual meetings must act swiftly to take advantage of record-high gold prices.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 16:02:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Macron’s Tragedy</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/causes-of-french-political-crisis-by-zaki-laidi-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/causes-of-french-political-crisis-by-zaki-laidi-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The tragedy of Emmanuel Macron’s presidency is that what was billed as an alternative to hyper-partisanship has only deepened partisanship.

But a recent two-day internet blackout in Afghanistan, which briefly cut off this crucial lifeline, could be the start of a worrying expansion of the regime’s gender apartheid.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 11:46:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The EU Must Stand Up to Trump</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-must-stand-up-to-trump-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eu-must-stand-up-to-trump-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It makes no sense for an economic bloc as large as the European Union to fold to a reckless US president who is driven entirely by personal obsessions and whose word means nothing.
