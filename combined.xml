&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted on Sunday that Israel would decide for itself when to strike its foes and which countries could join an international security force in Gaza, as Egyptian recovery crews arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian convoy, captured on camera by AFP reporters in Khan Yunis in the south of the Gaza Strip, included heavy machinery to help speed the search for the remains of deceased Israeli hostages lost in the rubble of the devastated Palestinian territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BASRA,Iraq (Reuters) -At least two workers were killed in an oil pipeline fire in Iraq's Zubair oilfield on Sunday, oilfield officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no impact on oil flows, they said, with throughput currently at 400,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blaze, which also seriously wounded five workers, erupted while a group of workers were conducting welding operations near the pipeline, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefighters were working to extinguish the fire, which broke out on a section of the pipeline that transports crude oil from the Zubair field to nearby storage tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

The fighting has killed more than 40,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
