&lt;p&gt;Thousands of visitors streamed through the Grand Egyptian Museum on Tuesday as almost the entire collection of King Tutankhamun's treasures -- over 4,500 artefacts -- was displayed together for the first time since the young pharaoh's tomb was discovered in 1922.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curated and conserved over nearly two decades, the collection was unveiled to the public two days after the museum's lavish opening ceremony on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick Cheney, who became one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history as George W. Bush’s number two during 9/11 and catastrophic wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, died Monday. He was 84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheney forged an influential role in the traditionally inconsequential job and was a major power behind the throne as Bush thrust America into the so-called war on terror, with a dark underbelly of renditions, torture and the Guantanamo prison site.&lt;/p&gt;

Medical supplies would follow soon, he said, as his ministry promoted the hashtag #IndiaFirstResponder on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) -Dick Cheney, a driving force behind the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, was considered by presidential historians as one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died at age 84 on Monday from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican - a former Wyoming congressman and secretary of defense - was already a major Washington player when then-Texas governor George W. Bush chose him to be his running mate in the 2000 presidential race that Bush went on to win. &lt;/p&gt;
