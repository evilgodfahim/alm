a move that triggered a major feud between Gulf powers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southern Transitional Council (STC) is backed by the United Arab Emirates and has for years been part of Yemen's internationally recognised government which is supported by Saudi Arabia and has led the fight against the Houthi movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:01:37
