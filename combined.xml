While Congress's abdication of its constitutional duties is well known, the Supreme Court has joined it in greenlighting executive overreach.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 15:40:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Can Ethical Supply Chains Survive the Tariff Storm?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/tariffs-supply-chain-volatility-favors-companies-with-responsible-purchasing-commitments-by-joleen-ong-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/tariffs-supply-chain-volatility-favors-companies-with-responsible-purchasing-commitments-by-joleen-ong-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As trade-related costs persist, fashion and apparel industry leaders must shift their mindset.
