&lt;p&gt;SOUTHERN ISRAEL (Reuters) -An international security force to be put in place in Gaza under a ceasefire agreement will have to be made up of countries that Israel is "comfortable with", U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday during a visit to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubio added that the future of governance in Gaza still needs to be worked out among Israel and partner nations but could not include Hamas, adding that any potential role for the Palestinian Authority has yet to be determined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Simon Lewis; writing by Susan Heavey; editing by Mark Heinrich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANKARA (Reuters) -Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the United States and others must do more to push Israel to stop violating the Gaza ceasefire agreement, including the possible use of sanctions or halting arms sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an official readout of his remarks to reporters aboard a return flight from Oman, Erdogan said the Palestinian militant group Hamas was abiding by the agreement. He added that Turkey remains ready to support the planned Gaza task force in any way needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would never bow to pressure from the United States or any other country, and cautioned that the response to any strikes deep into Russia would be very serious and overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. sanctions are an "unfriendly" act and "will have certain consequences, but they will not significantly affect our economic well-being," Putin said. Russia's energy sector feels confident, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
