&lt;p&gt;By Gabriel Stargardter, Juliette Jabkhiro and Elissa Darwish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) -Crime gangs around Europe are increasingly robbing valuable jewels and gold from cash-needy museums like the Louvre, but while law enforcement often catches the thieves, they struggle to recover the priceless goods, police and art experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small pool of criminals would be capable of such a job as Sunday's audacious robbery in Paris and may already be known to police, the specialists say. But the objects themselves could be quickly broken down into component parts and sold on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a year trapped in a dark tunnel under Gaza, Eli Sharabi is determined to move forward with his life, even as he knows that pain and grief will be constant companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's impossible to forget even a single moment of my captivity," the 53-year-old Israeli former hostage told AFP in an interview on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it does not define who I am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharabi was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Beeri during the unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That day, he lost almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;
