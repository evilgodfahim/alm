&lt;p&gt;By Jennifer Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) -Eradicating polio is still possible despite significant funding cuts to the effort, global health officials said on Tuesday as they outlined how they will cope with the shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The budget of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a partnership including the World Health Organization and the Gates Foundation, will take a 30% cut in 2026 and has a $1.7 billion funding gap up to 2029, the organisation says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shortfall is largely driven by a pullback from foreign aid led by the United States and other wealthy donor governments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) -The British government on Tuesday removed Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the group which spearheaded the Syrian rebel alliance that helped oust President Bashar al-Assad, from its list of banned terrorist organisations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTS, a former al Qaeda affiliate, was proscribed in 2017, meaning that Britain designated it as a terrorist group, making it illegal to support or join it. &lt;/p&gt;
