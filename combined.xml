&lt;p&gt;By Ariba Shahid and Saad Sayeed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD, Jan 7 - Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is facing acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about U.S. commitments in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Andrew Mills and Rachna  Uppal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Turmoil in Yemen's south has exposed a major feud between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, yet their $30 billion trade ties are proving remarkably resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is unlikely to be any repeat of the trade boycott that hit Qatar in 2017 during its standoff with Gulf states, because there is simply too much at stake for both Saudi and the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY IS THE SAUDI-UAE ROW NOT LIKELY TO HIT TRADE ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROME, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Italy has begun repatriating dozens of its citizens stranded on the Yemeni island of Socotra, with a first flight carrying 46 tourists due to land in Jeddah on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 59 Italians remain on the island and are expected to return on additional flights in the coming days, as authorities work with Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Saudi authorities will grant the Italians a four-day transit visa to help facilitate their return home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 7 (Reuters) - Iran's clerical establishment is under mounting pressure from a new bout of unrest over economic privations caused by inflation that has rocketed since a war last June when Israeli and U.S. forces launched airstrikes, mainly targeting its nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite repeated outbreaks of nationwide protests stretching back decades, Iran's opposition has remained fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions and appears to have little organised presence inside the Islamic Republic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some opposition groups or blocs:    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONARCHISTS&lt;/p&gt;
