At the heart of this shift is China, whose massive push into green manufacturing could accelerate the clean-energy transition and consolidate its industrial dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 12:54:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Money Will Not Be Revolutionized</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/future-of-money-cbdc-stablecoins-tokenized-assets-no-bitcoin-revolution-by-nouriel-roubini-and-brunello-rosa-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/future-of-money-cbdc-stablecoins-tokenized-assets-no-bitcoin-revolution-by-nouriel-roubini-and-brunello-rosa-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The future of money and payment systems will be characterized by evolution, not some radical crypto revolution of the kind envisioned by Bitcoin advocates.

In fact, with its vast population and robust domestic demand, India is better positioned than most to withstand external shocks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:59:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Do or Die for the United Nations</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-nations-must-adapt-or-die-by-adekeye-adebajo-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-nations-must-adapt-or-die-by-adekeye-adebajo-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With US President Donald Trump blithely brushing aside the United Nations’ many achievements, it is worth revisiting the organization’s successes and failures over the years. While it is obvious that the world’s premier multilateral body must reform, it is equally obvious that we would all be worse off without it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:26:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>United States, Inc.</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/united-states-inc</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/united-states-inc</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From “transactional” trade deals and “efficiency” drives to pay-to-play immigration policies, Donald Trump appears determined to govern the United States like a business. But a profit-seeking government will never provide an adequate supply of public goods, and the lawless version pursued by Trump, a serial bankrupt, is poorly suited to anything other than self-enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:00:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Picture</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-states-inc-doc-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-states-inc-doc-2025-09</guid><description></description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 15:59:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Are US Democrats Really Soft on Crime?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-national-guard-deployments-ignore-republican-city-high-crime-rates-by-ian-ayres-and-jacob-slaughter-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-national-guard-deployments-ignore-republican-city-high-crime-rates-by-ian-ayres-and-jacob-slaughter-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While US President Donald Trump deploys National Guard troops to major cities governed by Democrats, the data show that violent crime rates are actually much higher elsewhere.

The continent’s leaders must dare to imagine a new multilateral system that values people over profit, care over competition, and collective dignity over extractive growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 14:31:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Are MAGA Voters Rational?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-do-trump-supporters-vote-against-their-economic-interests-by-jeffrey-frankel-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-do-trump-supporters-vote-against-their-economic-interests-by-jeffrey-frankel-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Since the study of economics relies on the assumption that people largely act in their rational self-interest, when people vote otherwise, economists are likely to blame faulty or missing information.

The app's owner, ByteDance, will no longer oversee daily content recommendations, but China will still have residual control over the platform's algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 11:41:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>“America First” Accounting Standards?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sec-threatening-international-accounting-standards-rule-by-howard-davies-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sec-threatening-international-accounting-standards-rule-by-howard-davies-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump’s new SEC chairman has threatened to require foreign companies listed in the US to reconcile their international-standards-based reporting with US reporting principles.

Rather than wait around hoping for the US to re-embrace reason, democratic values, and global leadership, the “rest of the West” must step up to preserve the foundations of global stability and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:08:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China Plans, America Reacts</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reactive-industrial-policy-cannot-compare-to-china-five-year-plans-by-stephen-s-roach-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-reactive-industrial-policy-cannot-compare-to-china-five-year-plans-by-stephen-s-roach-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump’s transactional strain of industrial policy has prompted many to ask whether he has embraced Chinese-style state capitalism. But Trumponomics, lacking an overarching strategy and largely based on the whims of one man, is nothing like China’s comprehensive “all-of-government” approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 13:23:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Robert Redford and the Leadership America Has Lost</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-redford-and-the-civic-political-leadership-america-has-lost-by-carla-norrlof-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-redford-and-the-civic-political-leadership-america-has-lost-by-carla-norrlof-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Through his films, conservation efforts, and the Sundance festival, Robert Redford enjoyed global fame for most of his adult life.
