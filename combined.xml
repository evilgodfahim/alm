&lt;p&gt;By Jaidaa Taha and Tamar  Beeri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAIRO/JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel released almost 2,000 Palestinians from its custody this month in exchange for 20 Israeli hostages held by Hamas, as part of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include 250 prisoners, some members of Palestinian militant groups, who were either convicted or charged with carrying out, taking part in, or planning deadly attacks. Hamas said 154 of the 250 convicted prisoners were deported to Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would never bow to pressure from the United States or any other country, and cautioned that the response to any strikes deep into Russia would be very serious and overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. sanctions are an "unfriendly" act and "will have certain consequences, but they will not significantly affect our economic well-being," Putin said. Russia's energy sector feels confident, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
