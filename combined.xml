&lt;p&gt;Shiite Islam may be the official religion in Iran, but entering Tehran's brand-new Maryam Moghaddas metro station, you could be forgiven for feeling as if you're stepping inside a Christian church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maryam Moghaddas in Persian translates as "Holy Mary". And the station's vaulted and arched concourse, with a dome decorated with Persian motifs, features religious frescoes and artworks honouring Christianity's Virgin Mary, the mother of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

Forcing someone to wear one would be punishable with prison terms of up to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face veils would still be allowed in aeroplanes, diplomatic premises and places of worship. &lt;/p&gt;
