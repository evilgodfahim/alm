&lt;p&gt;Jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti's son urged US President Donald Trump to "seize the opportunity" created by the Gaza truce to secure his father's release and revive the two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes dubbed the "Mandela of Palestine" by his supporters, Marwan Barghouti, 66, was one of the leaders of the second intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, and is often cited as a possible successor to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The families of Israeli hostages Monday called for the next phase of the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire to be delayed until Hamas returns the bodies of its remaining dead captives, even as Egyptian rescuers joined the hunt for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hamas knows exactly where every one of the deceased hostages is held. Two weeks have passed since the deadline set in the agreement for the return of all 48 hostages, yet 13 remain in Hamas captivity," the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.&lt;/p&gt;
