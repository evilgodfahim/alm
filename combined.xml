&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) -The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will stay closed through Wednesday and the flow of aid into the Palestinian enclave will be reduced, three Israeli officials said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision came after Palestinian militant group Hamas did not hand over bodies of hostages it is holding as part of the new U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, the officials said, without elaborating on how long the move would last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday lifted its outlook for global growth this year, flagging a milder-than-expected economic hit from President Donald Trump's tariff policies while warning of risks ahead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its flagship World Economic Outlook (WEO) report -- compiled before the most recent US-China tariff spat -- the IMF hiked its 2025 global growth forecast to 3.2 percent, up from 3.0 in July, while leaving its prediction for 2026 unchanged at 3.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GENEVA (Reuters) -The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Tuesday that it will take time to hand over the remains of hostages and detainees killed in the Israel-Hamas war, calling it a "massive challenge" given the difficulties of finding bodies amid Gaza's rubble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's an even bigger challenge than having the people alive being released. That's a massive challenge," said the ICRC's spokesperson Christian Cardon, adding it could take days or weeks and that there was a possibility they were never found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Emma FargeEditing by Ludwig Burger)&lt;/p&gt;
