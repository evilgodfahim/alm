new parliament elected a senior figure from the Sunni Taqadom party as its speaker Monday, the first session since November elections that consolidated the main parties' grip on power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parliament's media office said 309 out of 329 lawmakers took part in the inaugural session, with Haibat al-Halbussi, 45, emerging as the winner from three candidates, with 208 votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By convention, a Shiite Muslim holds the post of prime minister, the parliament speaker is Sunni and the largely ceremonial presidency goes to a Kurd.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:00:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Tehran shopkeepers shut stores over economic
