&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran executed on Saturday an individual accused of spying for Israel, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported on Sunday citing an Iranian prosecutor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual had links to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad and had leaked classified information, Mizan cited the judiciary official as saying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entangled in a decades-long shadow war with Israel, Iran has executed many people it accused of having links with Israel's intelligence service and facilitating its operations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) -The Israeli military has launched an attack on Gaza, as Israel continued to trade blame with Palestinian militant group Hamas over violations of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire aiming to end the war in the enclave, Israeli media reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate comment from the military or Hamas on the reported attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli public broadcaster Kan said the air force was attacking Rafah in the south of Gaza. Most media outlets described the attack as air strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
