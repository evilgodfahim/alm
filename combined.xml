After all, it is much easier for other countries to develop alternatives to the dollar than for America suddenly to develop its own rare earths industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 10:02:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Restoring Public-Sector Capacity Where It Counts</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-investing-in-city-governance-matters-by-mariana-mazzucato-and-rainer-kattel-2025-10</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-investing-in-city-governance-matters-by-mariana-mazzucato-and-rainer-kattel-2025-10</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Cities are where tomorrow’s opportunities will be seized and where today’s crises, from climate change to inequality, hit hardest. Strengthening city governments is therefore a strategic imperative that requires significant investment, sustained coordination, and continuous learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 08:52:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>To Survive, the United Nations Must Leave America</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/un-should-leave-new-york-us-headquarters-by-carl-bildt-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/un-should-leave-new-york-us-headquarters-by-carl-bildt-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While the demand for what the United Nations does is as great as ever, its ability to deliver has obviously been diminished. There is no way for it to survive without scaling back its ambitions and abilities, and that, in turn, may require a move to a more hospitable country.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:51:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>America’s Crypto Apocalypse</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-stablecoin-law-genius-act-risk-to-financial-stability-democracy-sovereignty-by-hilary-j-allen-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-stablecoin-law-genius-act-risk-to-financial-stability-democracy-sovereignty-by-hilary-j-allen-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By opening the floodgates for “stablecoins,” Congress has made the US financial system more vulnerable to crises, increased the chances of government bailouts for tech platforms, and further entrenched Silicon Valley’s political power. In fact, such outcomes seem to be exactly what some techno-boosters want.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 14:46:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump’s Beggar-the-Poor Remittance Tax</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-remittance-tax-wake-up-call-to-developing-countries-by-hippolyte-fofack-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-remittance-tax-wake-up-call-to-developing-countries-by-hippolyte-fofack-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Remittance inflows to low-income countries have improved welfare, reduced poverty, and enhanced economic resilience. But with the Trump administration’s 1% tax on remittances threatening to erode these benefits, the developing world must address the underlying causes of brain drain and pursue technology-led growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 13:11:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The World of Yesterday</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-us-european-order-now-world-of-yesterday-by-joschka-fischer-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-us-european-order-now-world-of-yesterday-by-joschka-fischer-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For decades, Europeans have been deeply attached to the idea of the transatlantic West, and to an image of America as a bastion of freedom, democracy, and security.

To focus exclusively on identity – on race and gender – while ignoring the material reality of class and repudiating the working class itself, is a catastrophic strategic error.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 09:30:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How Asia Can Reduce Its Dollar Dependence</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/asian-policymakers-must-focus-on-managing-vulnerabilities-not-displacing-dollar-by-yasuto-watanabe-and-hiro-ito-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/asian-policymakers-must-focus-on-managing-vulnerabilities-not-displacing-dollar-by-yasuto-watanabe-and-hiro-ito-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Despite heightened geopolitical tensions and escalating trade wars, the US dollar’s global dominance is unlikely to fade in the near term. This leaves Asian economies vulnerable to dollar shocks, underscoring the need for deeper regional cooperation and stronger financial safety nets.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 08:35:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>On Climate Change, Capital Must Follow Africa’s Lead</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-investors-can-support-africa-clean-energy-transition-by-georgia-levenson-keohane-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-investors-can-support-africa-clean-energy-transition-by-georgia-levenson-keohane-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;With its vast solar resources and rapidly growing population, Africa has the potential to achieve a green transition that delivers sustainable and inclusive growth. But achieving this will require closing a $2.8 trillion financing shortfall by mobilizing international capital for African-led initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 16:00:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A New Paradigm for Financing Education</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/education-financing-as-a-core-component-of-economic-development-by-bola-ahmed-tinubu-and-jakaya-kikwete-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/education-financing-as-a-core-component-of-economic-development-by-bola-ahmed-tinubu-and-jakaya-kikwete-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to replenishing global financial support for education, developing countries also need a new strategy to establish self-sustaining education systems that can deliver consistent quality for all children.

The design of the Security Council has become a recipe for paralysis, but that is only the start of the organization's problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 13:55:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Changing Face of Foreign Direct Investment</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/foreign-direct-investment-reshaping-global-economic-landscape-by-jayati-ghosh-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/foreign-direct-investment-reshaping-global-economic-landscape-by-jayati-ghosh-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Once dominated by a handful of advanced economies, foreign direct investment is being reoriented toward Africa and Southeast Asia. At the heart of this shift is China, whose massive push into green manufacturing could accelerate the clean-energy transition and consolidate its industrial dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 12:54:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Money Will Not Be Revolutionized</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/future-of-money-cbdc-stablecoins-tokenized-assets-no-bitcoin-revolution-by-nouriel-roubini-and-brunello-rosa-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/future-of-money-cbdc-stablecoins-tokenized-assets-no-bitcoin-revolution-by-nouriel-roubini-and-brunello-rosa-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The future of money and payment systems will be characterized by evolution, not some radical crypto revolution of the kind envisioned by Bitcoin advocates.

While it is obvious that the world’s premier multilateral body must reform, it is equally obvious that we would all be worse off without it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:26:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>United States, Inc.</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/united-states-inc</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/united-states-inc</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From “transactional” trade deals and “efficiency” drives to pay-to-play immigration policies, Donald Trump appears determined to govern the United States like a business. But a profit-seeking government will never provide an adequate supply of public goods, and the lawless version pursued by Trump, a serial bankrupt, is poorly suited to anything other than self-enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:00:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Picture</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-states-inc-doc-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/united-states-inc-doc-2025-09</guid><description></description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 15:59:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Are US Democrats Really Soft on Crime?</title><link>https://archive.is/o/xWwb1/https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-national-guard-deployments-ignore-republican-city-high-crime-rates-by-ian-ayres-and-jacob-slaughter-2025-09</link><guid>https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-national-guard-deployments-ignore-republican-city-high-crime-rates-by-ian-ayres-and-jacob-slaughter-2025-09</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;While US President Donald Trump deploys National Guard troops to major cities governed by Democrats, the data show that violent crime rates are actually much higher elsewhere.
