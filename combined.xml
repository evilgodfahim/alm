&lt;p&gt;ANKARA (Reuters) -President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Turkey had entered a "new phase" in efforts to end Kurdish militant violence and signalled he was open to the idea of jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan addressing lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erdogan said he held "very constructive" talks last week with senior pro-Kurdish DEM Party leaders - who have urged the idea of Ocalan addressing a parliamentary commission on PKK disarmament - and he urged all actors to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIV Golf will abandon its abbreviated 54-hole format in favor of 72-hole tournaments in 2026, officials said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saudi-backed circuit, whose name is derived from the Roman numeral for '54', had previously touted its three-round tournaments as a core distinction from traditional golf events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the 54-hole format prevented LIV events from earning Official Golf World Rankings points, making it harder for LIV players to qualify for golf's majors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Mike Stone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration is considering a Saudi Arabian request to buy as many as 48 F-35 fighter jets, a potential multi-billion-dollar deal that has cleared a key Pentagon hurdle ahead of a visit by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, two sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sale would mark a significant policy shift, potentially altering the military balance in the Middle East and testing Washington's definition of maintaining Israel's "qualitative military edge." &lt;/p&gt;

His hawkish brand of neoconservatism, including the invasion of Iraq, began to be repudiated even before he left office, and today both major US parties largely reject his views.&lt;/p&gt;
